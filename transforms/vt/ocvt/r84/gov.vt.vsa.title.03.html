        Access to records.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the general right of access to public records under the Public Records Act, the more specific and exacting legislative requirements that a retiring governor’s official correspondence be placed in the state archives and that such records be made “accessible only in accord with” the special terms or conditions restricting their use, must control. The statutes, in short, evince an express legislative intent to authorize the “special term” restricting access to a former governor’s archived records. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 2005 VT 108, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191, 2005 Vt. LEXIS 304 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative history supports the conclusion that one purpose of the Archives Act was to codify the secretary of state’s longstanding practice—separate and apart from any limitations contained in the Public Records Act—of accepting retiring governors’ official papers with broad restrictions on public access for periods of years. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 2005 VT 108, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191, 2005 Vt. LEXIS 304 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court erred in invalidating the special term of the memorandum of understanding restricting access to designated portions of the former governor’s official correspondence in the State archives. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 2005 VT 108, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191, 2005 Vt. LEXIS 304 (2005).

        Governor’s records.

      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the general right of access to public records under the Public Records Act, the more specific and exacting legislative requirements that a retiring governor’s official correspondence be placed in the state archives and that such records be made “accessible only in accord with” the special terms or conditions restricting their use, must control. The statutes, in short, evince an express legislative intent to authorize the “special term” restricting access to a former governor’s archived records. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 2005 VT 108, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191, 2005 Vt. LEXIS 304 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative history supports the conclusion that one purpose of the Archives Act was to codify the secretary of state’s longstanding practice-separate and apart from any limitations contained in the Public Records Act -of accepting retiring governors’ official papers with broad restrictions on public access for periods of years. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 2005 VT 108, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191, 2005 Vt. LEXIS 304 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court erred in invalidating the special term of the memorandum of understanding restricting access to designated portions of the former governor’s official correspondence in the State archives. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 2005 VT 108, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191, 2005 Vt. LEXIS 304 (2005).

       While the Legislature carved out a limited role for complainants in its statute governing professional discipline boards, it did not create an adversarial process between the complainant and the licensee entitling the complainant to review the licensee’s submissions to the Office of Professional Regulation at the investigative stage of the proceedings.

       Fact that Legislature amended statute governing professional conduct boards, so as to include power to deny a request for withdrawal of a license application, did not demonstrate that such power had previously been lacking, because legislation containing amendment was enacted to reinstate former policy and was intended to clarify rather than change existing law.

       <p>
        Attorney for the Office of Professional Regulation (OPR) within the office of the Vermont Secretary of State had the power to appeal from a Board of Nursing decision vacating an earlier consent order suspending appellee from practice, as the State was entitled to appeal from an adverse ruling and the legislature intended that OPR attorneys act for the State in filing and pursuing such appeals. Shaddy v. State Office of Prof'l Regulation, 2014 VT 111, 197 Vt. 625, 112 A.3d 718, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 113 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature intended in its 2003 enactments that Office of Professional Regulation (OPR) attorneys assume the role formerly played by the Attorney General and represent the State of Vermont in such proceedings to discharge the burden imposed by statute. The Vermont Supreme Court construes the statutes in Title 3, Chapter 5, Subchapter 3, with respect to professional regulation and OPR, to embody this power; thus, OPR attorneys represent the State of Vermont and may exercise the State’s power to appeal from an adverse decision of a board. Shaddy v. State Office of Prof'l Regulation, 2014 VT 111, 197 Vt. 625, 112 A.3d 718, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 113 (2014).

        Professional discipline process should not be used as a pretext, a substitute for, or alternative to, employment laws that define and enforce the rights of employers and employees. Simply put, being a bad manager—even a temperamental, unpredictable, harsh, and demanding one—might not necessarily constitute unprofessional conduct for the purposes of State disciplinary action against a licensed nursing home administrator. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 2013 VT 93, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489, 2013 Vt. LEXIS 104 (2013).

        Pursuant to statutory authority, Vermont has adopted the Administrative Rules for Licensed Midwives, and several of the midwifery rules were implicated in a case seeking immediate summary suspension of a midwife’s license to practice midwifery. Each time the midwife violated a midwifery rule, she also committed unprofessional conduct. Devers-Scott v. Office of Professional Regulation, 2007 VT 4, 181 Vt. 248, 918 A.2d 230, 2007 Vt. LEXIS 3 (2007).

        By establishing one standard of proof for all professions and occupations regulated by secretary of state, legislature did not intend to lower an extant burden of proof for nurse licensing actions, but rather intended to avoid inefficiency of administering a patchwork of standards adopted by various boards.

        There was no merit to respondent engineer’s contention that unprofessional conduct charges were fundamentally flawed or contrary to public policy when the Office of Professional Regulation decided in its discretion, following an investigation, that charges were warranted and then held a hearing. In re Bombardier, 2018 VT 11, 206 Vt. 450, 182 A.3d 1165, 2018 Vt. LEXIS 8 (2018).
       </p>

        Board of Professional Engineering did not misconstrue the scope of respondent engineer’s undertaking, as respondent testified that he agreed to a very broad undertaking. In re Bombardier, 2018 VT 11, 206 Vt. 450, 182 A.3d 1165, 2018 Vt. LEXIS 8 (2018).

        Nursing home administrator could not be subjected to professional discipline and penalties based on deficiencies with the nursing home when the administrative law officer did not specifically find that she was responsible for their occurrence, but instead held her liable on the basis that administrators were charged with general administration of the home and were thus responsible for all that occurred there. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 2013 VT 93, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489, 2013 Vt. LEXIS 104 (2013).
       </p>

        No error was found in the administrative law officer’s conclusion that a midwife committed unprofessional conduct by failing to obtain written informed consent forms from her client, either for the home birth or for the special risks associated with a vaginal birth after cesarean. Devers-Scott v. Office of Professional Regulation, 2007 VT 4, 181 Vt. 248, 918 A.2d 230, 2007 Vt. LEXIS 3 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of midwife’s visit to a client’s home in New York, which included taking the client’s blood pressure and fetal heart tones, supported the administrative law officer’s (ALO’s) finding that she practiced midwifery in New York in violation of New York law. Therefore, the ALO did not err in concluding that she violated the statute listing as unprofessional conduct the failure to comply with provisions of federal or state statutes or rules governing the practice of the profession. Devers-Scott v. Office of Professional Regulation, 2007 VT 4, 181 Vt. 248, 918 A.2d 230, 2007 Vt. LEXIS 3 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Midwife failed in her argument that, because the conditions her client presented were not explicitly listed as triggers for a physician consultation in the midwifery rule, there was no support for the administrative law officer’s (ALO) conclusion that she should have consulted a physician. However, the ALO did not conclude that she violated the rule in this instance. Instead, the ALO reasonably concluded that, under the particular circumstances the client presented, the statute pertaining to the failure to practice competently required that a midwife, “in the exercise of caution and in providing competent and safe patient care
        .
        .
        . make the assumption that a full rupture of the amniotic membrane [has] occurred
        .
        .
        . [because t]he risks of making the opposite assumption
        .
        .
        . are simply too high.” Devers-Scott v. Office of Professional Regulation, 2007 VT 4, 181 Vt. 248, 918 A.2d 230, 2007 Vt. LEXIS 3 (2007).

       <p>
        Mistreatment of staff, patients, or visitors can constitute grounds for discipline if it rises to the level that it threatens the health, safety, and welfare of patients. Thus, a nursing home administrator engaged in professional misconduct by failing to practice competently in that her frequent and public abusive conduct toward staff members affected patient well-being. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 2013 VT 93, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489, 2013 Vt. LEXIS 104 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        When there were multiple instances in which a nursing home administrator interrupted nurses’ medication passes, causing delay, this supported a conclusion that she had engaged in professional misconduct by failing to practice competently. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 2013 VT 93, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489, 2013 Vt. LEXIS 104 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a nursing home administrator told a psychiatric nurse practitioner to diagnose a violent and agitated resident with bipolar disorder so that the resident would be moved to a psychiatric facility, this supported a conclusion that she engaged in unprofessional conduct by performing services beyond her education and training. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 2013 VT 93, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489, 2013 Vt. LEXIS 104 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nursing home administrator’s telling a patient that he did not need doctor-recommended care exceeded the scope of her training and qualifications, and supported the conclusion that she had engaged in unprofessional conduct by performing services beyond her education and training. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 2013 VT 93, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489, 2013 Vt. LEXIS 104 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that a nursing home administrator interfered with an ombudsman supported a conclusion that she had engaged in professional misconduct by failing to practice competently. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 2013 VT 93, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489, 2013 Vt. LEXIS 104 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that a nursing home administrator forced a dying patient on “comfort care” to change clothing against the patient’s wishes and had a resident placed in a chair when the resident wished to remain in bed supported a conclusion that she had engaged in professional misconduct by failing to practice competently. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 2013 VT 93, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489, 2013 Vt. LEXIS 104 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record not only substantially supported, but virtually compelled, the conclusion that midwife repeatedly engaged in unprofessional conduct and provided substandard care to her patients, and there was ample credible support in the record for the administrative law officer’s (ALO’s) further conclusion that her approach to the accusations itself raised doubts about her future ability to comply with the midwifery rules, the reach of which she has consistently sought to escape through hypertechnical constructions at odds with the rules’ protective purposes, the revocation of midwife’s license was an appropriate exercise of the ALO’s discretion. Devers-Scott v. Office of Professional Regulation, 2007 VT 4, 181 Vt. 248, 918 A.2d 230, 2007 Vt. LEXIS 3 (2007).
