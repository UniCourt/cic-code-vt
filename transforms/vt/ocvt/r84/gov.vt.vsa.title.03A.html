                    WHEREAS, the Vermont Minority/Women Business Enterprises Partnership was mandated to develop a plan to facilitate equal access and maximum opportunity to participate in state contracting procedures for Minority/Women Business Enterprises (M/WBEs) and

                            The State of Vermont recognizes the important contributions and vital impact which small businesses have on the state’s economy. In this regard, the state prescribes to a free and open bidding process that affords all businesses equal access and opportunity

                            these firms to compete for state contracts.

                    NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT I, James H. Douglas, by virtue of the power vested in me as Governor of the State of Vermont, do hereby establish the Governor’s Jobs Cabinet:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Jobs Cabinet shall consist of representatives from State agencies and departments and shall include representatives from outside state government. The State members shall include the Development Cabinet and the Commissioners of the Departments of
                    Labor and Industry, Employment and Training, and Public Service; the Manager of the Vermont Economic Development Authority; the Chancellor of the Vermont State Colleges or his or her designee; and the President of the University of
                    Vermont or his or her designee. There shall be thirteen non-State members appointed by the Governor to serve for terms of three years. The initial appointments of the non-State members shall include four one-year terms, four two-year
                    terms and five three-year terms. The Governor shall appoint the Chair. The Jobs Cabinet may, at its discretion, establish inter-agency work groups to support its mission, drawing membership from any agency or department of state government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Administrative support to the Cabinet shall be provided by the Agency of Commerce and Community Development. Public members may receive reimbursement of expenses in attending Cabinet meetings and may receive a per diem pursuant to
                    <cite class="vt_code">
       32 V.S.A. § 1010
      </cite> . The Jobs Cabinet shall meet at the call of the Chair to carry out the following responsibilities:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Work collaboratively to identify and meet the needs of job generators and remove impediments to job growth whenever practicable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Open dialogue and establish strategic partnerships among government and key organizations to achieve the goal of greater job creation. The Jobs Cabinet and individual state agencies may refer specific job development projects that present complex and
                    unique issues or require interagency coordination among state agencies and departments to the Chair. The Chair may establish a working group consisting of the State members for review and development of a plan to coordinate the state
                    agencies involved and resolve interagency conflicts, if any, to insure a coordinated and common sense approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Maintain an ongoing review of the state’s permitting processes and make recommendations that will assist business and housing to grow responsibly within a regulatory scheme that is fair, predictable, expedient, and cost-conscious. The Chair, in his
                    or her sole discretion, may refer any proposed project that will create additional jobs through expansion or location in Vermont to a working group consisting of State members for review. The working group may, to the extent practicable
                    and according to applicable laws, identify those aspects of the project where assistance in coordinating interagency communication, permitting or regulatory processes would assist review of the project in an efficient, reasonable and
                    timely fashion. The Chair, in his or her sole discretion, may refer a job development project to the Jobs Cabinet that has failed or chosen not to expand or locate in Vermont for review and identification of factors, including but
                    not limited to, infrastructure needs, state workforce deficiencies, and regulatory requirements, that contributed to the decision not to expand or locate in Vermont. The working group shall report to the full Jobs Cabinet a summary
                    of the projects it has considered and the factors identified as significant to the decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4) Remove barriers to and develop incentives for critical infrastructure investment in the State that is conducive to job creation such as broadband, wireless and power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5) Facilitate small business advocacy forums in each region of the state to create an inventory of the needs of small business, including but not limited to government assistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6) Research programs in other states, particularly competitors in the Northeast, to identify Vermont’s opportunities and weaknesses relative to those states, recommend where Vermont should focus its efforts, and develop strategies to improve Vermont’s
                    competitive position in those areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    7) Research and closely monitor national and international business trends to help Vermont’s economic development strategy stay ahead of its competitors. Identify emerging markets or potential growth areas such as exporting, technology, biotech, and engineering
                    and design appropriate recruiting strategies for those industry sectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    8) Proactively seek to retain existing Vermont businesses and encourage job growth by developing networks for marketing and purchasing while creating links to other businesses for service and collaborative action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    9) Create and support a culture of entrepreneurship where new enterprise and innovation, especially within the high-tech industry, require private capital to grow and thrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    10) Continuously seek ways to capitalize on Vermont’s key natural resources such as granite, wood, marble and agriculture with substantial consideration to value added products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    11) Encourage the creation, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing that is affordable to working Vermonters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    12) Encourage the reuse of buildings, manufacturing facilities and other infrastructure in our traditional downtown areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    13) Assure that the State’s efforts, and those of this Jobs Cabinet, to maintain and create new jobs recognize the importance of assuring Vermont’s environmental heritage and ethic, and that the quality of our environment will support the goals of the
                    Jobs Cabinet, and that a strengthened economy will benefit the State’s ability to protect the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    14) Advise the Governor on the effectiveness of this Order on job creation and retention in Vermont.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Executive Order shall take effect upon execution.

                                The Job Offer Program:   The Department of Human Resources and VSEA negotiated a pre-RIF jobs program that permits Vermont State Hospital employees to receive mandatory offers of employment to other positions in the Agency of Human Services prior to any
                                actual reduction in force (the Job Offer Program). As part of the Job Offer Program, the Department of Human Resources hosted several informational meetings and a day-long event where employees could meet with recruitment
                                counselors to get additional information about the program and the potential jobs available.  (To date, 41 employees elected to participate in the program and 11 found new employment in the Agency of Human Services.)

                                The Department and VSEA negotiated language that is included in H.630 to give any VSH employee subject to the RIF, but later rehired by state government, the opportunity to return to their prior job when the new state hospital
                                opens, subject to seniority and other contract rights and obligations.

                                until one year after the opening of the successor facility.  In this way, VSH employees who are no longer employed by state government will have reemployment possibilities at any successor hospital.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermonters with criminal records suffer from discrimination in many areas of life, including employment opportunities;
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, state government is committed to modeling fair hiring practices for all Vermont employers;
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, too many Vermonters with criminal records are unable to successfully re-enter their communities due to lack of employment and self-sufficiency;
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermonters with criminal records represent a workforce with skills to contribute and a desire to add value to their communities;
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, studies indicate that stable employment is one of the best predictors of post-conviction success;
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, employment of those with criminal records promotes public safety and cost-containment by significantly reducing the risk of recidivism and incarceration;
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, a “ban the box” hiring policy increases the opportunity of applicants with criminal records to explain their circumstances while preserving employers’ ability to ultimately conduct a criminal background check as part of the hiring process;
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, such a policy removes questions related to a job applicant’s criminal record in the initial stage of many employment applications, thereby preventing the conviction from serving as an immediate reason for screening out an applicant when the conviction
                    may have little or no bearing on the work to be performed;
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, states across the country have adopted hiring practices to remove unfair barriers to employment of people with criminal records; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to maximize compliance with federal anti-discrimination law, recommends delaying inquiry of a job applicant’s conviction history and considering the job-relatedness of the conviction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that I, Peter Shumlin, by virtue of the power vested in me as the Governor of the State of Vermont, do hereby order and direct that the Department of Human Resources create and implement a “ban the box” hiring policy that
                    encourages job applications from all motivated, hardworking, and otherwise qualified people, regardless of a person’s criminal record. Such a policy shall provide qualified applicants the opportunity to explain a criminal record when
                    applying for state positions, but shall not affect positions for which a criminal conviction makes a candidate ineligible regardless of the circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Executive Order shall take effect upon signing.

                    WHEREAS, homelessness has been a persistent and growing problem within Vermont for more than 30 years, affecting children, young adults, working families, and veterans;

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, both the financial and human costs of homelessness strain public services including health care, mental health care, and education;

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, as federal housing resources have declined, affordable housing production in Vermont has slowed and homelessness has increased;

                    WHEREAS, Vermont has a commitment to the quality of life for all of its citizens, including through the launch of a statewide initiative to end child and family homelessness in Vermont by 2020;

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, State investments targeted to Vermonters experiencing homelessness — including the Vermont Rental Subsidy, Family Supportive Housing, Housing Opportunity Program, and Subsidy and Care Program — have shown effectiveness at breaking the cycle of

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the 2015 annual point-in-time count showed a modest decrease in homelessness statewide, and housing partners across Vermont should commit to building on successes to date; and

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, in addition to increasing access to affordable housing, success in ending homelessness requires a coordinated continuum of supports and services including Short-Term Emergency Shelter, Targeted Transitional Housing, Rental Subsidies, Targeted

                </h3>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, opioid addiction and abuse in the State of Vermont negatively affect all people, of all ages, in all communities, at all income levels; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, opioid addiction and abuse has caused and continues to cause an increase in drug trafficking and other criminal offenses throughout Vermont which erodes our way of life and endangers all Vermonters; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, opioid addiction and abuse has caused an increasing number of overdose deaths in Vermont, particularly among young Vermonters; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the fight against opioid addiction and abuse continues to consume an increasing portion of scarce State resources; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, because it is not feasible or effective to rely solely on state social service agencies or law enforcement to resolve the opioid crisis, all Vermonters must play an important role in helping to eradicate this scourge from our State; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, to effectively meet this challenge, the State, municipalities, and all Vermonters must work together on a three-pronged approach to this crisis:
                </p>
                <p>
                    • the demand for opioids must be significantly reduced through education, the building of strong families and neighborhoods, and increased economic and job opportunities;
                </p>
                <p>
                    • those addicted to opioids must be afforded adequate and effective treatment and recovery opportunities; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    • the supply of opioids must be reduced through robust and coordinated federal, state, and local law enforcement targeting drug traffickers and through more effective means of preventing the diversion of prescription opioids; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the Governor recognizes the diversity of Vermont municipalities and the distinct differences of population, geography, and resources; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the successful fight against opioid addiction and abuse will rely on the strength of this local diversity to enable and empower local authorities to adapt recommended policies, programs, and best practices to the needs of the various communities;
                    and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the City of Rutland has seen a significant decrease in opioid-related crime after successfully implementing Project VISION, a locally-driven strategy to identify and eliminate neighborhood drug markets utilizing a creative, collaborative grass-roots
                    effort involving individuals, families, local businesses, churches, law enforcement, community development organizations, and health care professionals; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, in order to fully enable and empower local communities in their fight against opioid addiction and abuse and to build on the success of Project VISION, there is a need to ensure full coordination among State agencies, State municipalities, law
                    enforcement, and treatment providers to strengthen Vermont’s overall response to the opioid crisis through effective opioid addiction prevention, treatment, recovery and enforcement action plans.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the States of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington and the District of Columbia have taken steps to legalize the recreational use of marijuana and/or establish systems for the licensing, regulation
                    and taxation of the sale and distribution of marijuana; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermont must adopt a balanced approach to marijuana legalization which takes into consideration realities of current consumption levels, legalization in neighboring jurisdictions, and facts regarding local impacts, the risk of harm to our youth,
                    impaired driving and the social consequences of drug use and addiction, particularly in the context of the State’s opioid crisis; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermont can pursue a regional approach with the northeastern states of Maine and Massachusetts, as well as Canada, to create universal highway safety and public health regulations to ensure health and safety as it relates to recreational marijuana
                    usage; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermont governors have created various executive orders over the years which address complex issues facing children and youth, public safety, criminal justice, substance abuse and population health; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, even if one accepts limited recreational use of marijuana as an individual choice, this choice cannot be permitted to adversely impact public health or safety, especially roadway safety and children’s health; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, in order to assess the potential for a system which permits the recreational use of marijuana and/or regulates and taxes the sale and distribution of marijuana in a way which is not volume- or profit-driven or detrimental to the interests of
                    a safe and healthy population, there is a need for a thoughtful and thorough consideration of public health, public safety and financial resource issues.

                    WHEREAS, increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks aimed at breaching and damaging essential computer networks, infrastructure, and operations in Vermont represent major security risks and increase the State’s vulnerability to adverse economic impacts,
                    life-threatening institutional disruption, critical infrastructure damage, privacy violations and identify theft; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the advancing complexity and incidence of these cyber attacks demands heightened levels of coordination, information sharing, preparation and emergency response capabilities among State government and federal agencies, local governments, tribal
                    governments, utilities, private companies, academic institutions, and other entities in order to protect computer networks and critical infrastructure systems from damage or unauthorized access; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermont State government agencies protect the State’s computer networks and investigate criminal attacks on State computer networks and critical infrastructure systems under current State law.

                    WHEREAS, it is essential to the proper operation of government that public officers be principled and impartial; that governmental decisions and policy be made fairly and impartially on the merits of the matter at issue; that public office not be used
                    for private gain other than the remuneration provided by law; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of government; and

       1 V.S.A. § 317(c)(7)
      </cite> The purpose of this questionnaire is to determine any significant personal interests of Appointees that might conflict with the best interests of the state. It is understood that individuals serving the state as Appointees
                    may have pecuniary interests that may relate to matters arising in the course of their performance of the official responsibilities. This form is intended to identify those interests and provide assurance that conflicts of interest
                    will not impair fair and impartial state actions. Appointees must avoid Conflicts of Interest and, where they do occur, must disclose them to the Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs. In answering questions, please disclose not
                    only your own direct interests but also any indirect or beneficial interests which could arise through members of your immediate family (spouses, dependent children) or through persons who reside in your home or by reason of a trust
                    or partnership arrangement in which you or a member of your immediate family or household participates or has an interest. (Use reverse side or an additional sheet or paper to give additional information, if necessary.) 1. Are you,
                    your spouse, or a member of your immediate family the director, officer, partner or employee of any enterprise that, to your knowledge, does business or has a financial relationship with the State of Vermont? If yes, please list all
                    such positions. Yes No 2. To the best of your knowledge, except for securities that are listed on a national exchange, do you own directly, indirectly, or beneficially, securities, options, or rights to purchase securities or share
                    in profits of companies doing business with the State? If yes, list company and percent of total shares. Yes No 3. Do you directly, indirectly or beneficially, have any ownership interest in a proprietorship, partnership, or syndicate
                    that, to your knowledge, operates any business which does business with the State? If yes, explain briefly. Yes No 4. To the best of your knowledge, does there currently exist any creditor-debtor relationship between you, directly
                    or indirectly, and any non-financial organization doing business with the State, except normal charge accounts and installment purchase accounts? If yes, explain briefly. Yes No 5. Are you receiving commissions or any forms of compensation,
                    gift or reward on business transacted with the State either directly or through a third person? If yes, explain briefly. Yes No 6. In addition to the information reported above, do you have any direct or indirect business relationships
                    which may reasonably be considered to have some influence on your judgment and decisions involving transactions with the State, or otherwise during the performance of your duties and responsibilities as a Appointee? If yes, explain
                    briefly. Yes No 7. Are you in good standing with respect to, or in full compliance with a plan to pay, any and all taxes due the State of Vermont, the State of Vermont and the municipality of residence? If no, explain. Yes No 8. If
                    you are under an obligation to pay child support, are you in good standing with respect to that obligation? Yes No If no, have you entered into a payment plan with the Vermont Office of Child Support and are you in full compliance
                    with that payment plan? Yes No 9. I agree to disassociate myself from situations where possible conflicts of interest pertaining to any matter addressed in this questionnaire might occur, when requested by the Governor or his or her
                    representative, the Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs. 10. To the best of my knowledge, the answers to all of the above questions are true and complete in every respect. Signed Date: Name (printed): Position:

                    than any other person; and

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the State of Vermont is committed to identifying racial, ethnic and other cultural disparities throughout State government systems and functions, and to eliminating them, as one of the state’s largest employers and as a provider of a variety

                    and councils, for example, the Department of Public Safety through its Fair and Impartial Policing Initiative; the Agency of Transportation through its Office of Civil Rights, the Agency of Education through partnerships with professional
                    associations in anti-bias efforts, and the Governor’s Workforce Equity and Diversity Council (GWEDC) in increasing minority representation in the state government workforce; and

                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, between 2007 and 2008, the Council of State Governments Justice Center (CSG), worked with Vermont state leaders to analyze Vermont’s criminal justice data, interview stakeholders across the criminal justice system, and develop data-driven policy
                    options designed to reduce corrections spending and increase public safety which resulted in 2008 justice reinvestment legislation which improved screening and assessment for behavioral health treatment needs, increased access to community-based
                    substance use treatment programs, focused supervision resources on individuals most likely to reoffend and expanded transitional housing opportunities and job training programs (“Justice Reinvestment I); and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Justice Reinvestment I successfully reversed upward pressure on the prison population which, in 2007 was projected to increase 23% by 2018, so that it actually fell 7% between Fiscal Year 2007 and Fiscal Year 2015; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, resources in our criminal justice system must continue to be deployed to combat crimes in our communities, but we must also thoughtfully evaluate whether we are effectively investing in strategies that break the cycle of crime and incarceration;

                    Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance and The Pew Charitable Trusts to gather data, evaluate processes and programs, and make recommendations on policies designed to most efficiently allocate resources while keeping
                    the public safe, thus freeing up funds for reinvestment in strategies that improve public safety and public welfare; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, this working group will bring state leaders, agencies and interested parties from across our criminal justice and behavioral health systems together to use data and best practices to inform policy changes and improvements.

                    WHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted racial inequities across the United States, including in Vermont. COVID-19 and other emergencies demonstrate that disparities in times of crisis are reflective of disparities in times of prosperity, and that
                    we must actively work to reduce structural inequities to ensure that no community is more vulnerable than another based on immutable factors such as race or ethnicity; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, we must bring state leaders, agencies and interested parties together from across Vermont to examine existing law on hate crimes, evaluate systems of support and look to increase civic participation among racially diverse populations.

                <p>
                    NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of the State of Vermont, do hereby create the Governor’s Racial Equity Task Force, as follows:

                    times of increasing economic stress, develop our outdoor recreation infrastructure and protect our natural resources, environment and public health often require complex and overlapping permitting and approval processes in an environment

                            of America, from the 5th to the 9th of September, 1989.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Included in the delegation were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Lenian P. Kitsa, the Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Vladislav V. Petukhov, Deputy Education Minister Valentina P. Makara and Vladimir G. Prozorov,
                            chief of the English faculty of the Karelian Pedagogical Institute and interpreter of the delegation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The delegation’s visit was in return for the visit of Governor Kunin and a delegation from the State of Vermont to the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, November 27-December 1, 1988.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chairman of the Presidium Filatov and the Karelian delegation visited Montpelier September 6, conferred with members of the Legislature, inspected a variety of industries, educational and health establishments and acquainted themselves with daily life
                            in Vermont.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The visit of the Soviet guests reinforced the conviction of both sides that a new constructive dialogue and openness is developing in relations between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a result of the decision
                            of President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their 1985 summit meeting to encourage people-to-people exchanges.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Both sides confirmed their desire to encourage friendly ties, develop contacts between counterpart organizations and institutions, and encourage businesslike relations between the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the State of Vermont
                            on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
                        </p>

                            Both sides, recognizing differences in their historic development, express their desire to enter into greater dialogue and mutual understanding in the interest of peace.

                        <p>
                            Both sides jointly declared that a state of friendship exists, in practice, between the State of Vermont and the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, and that a foundation has been laid for the creation of sister-state relations between the
                            State of Vermont and the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Both sides agreed to encourage and develop exchanges, official as well as unofficial, between the Republic and the State. These would involve short-term exchanges of citizens, teachers, students, local and state officials and others.

                    WHEREAS, the appropriation of $4,500,000 was to be “used to purchase and ensure that the lands commonly referred to as the Champion lands in northeastern Vermont are conserved as a working forest for the sustainable production of wood products, for natural
                    resources, including the maintenance of wildlife habitat and conservation of identified natural heritage sites, and for perpetual public access for traditional recreational uses”; and

                    managed for the sustainable growth and harvesting of timber and is perpetually open for public access; approximately 22,500 acres of state-owned land, the West Mountain Wildlife Management Area, conserved for perpetual public access

                <p>

                    and the Department of Economic, Housing, and Community Development (“DEHCD”), and at least twelve non-profit housing organizations, have as their primary purpose the common mission of serving the affordable housing community; and

                    WHEREAS, the viability of Vermont’s affordable housing delivery system is dependent upon preserving the economic value of receivables created by investments of Vermont taxpayers and maximizing the direct benefit of these investments to Vermonters seeking
                    affordable housing; and

                <p>

                    WHEREAS, the Tiger Team’s review concluded that a 10% savings in administrative costs within the five statewide entities alone would result in approximately $900,000 annually in direct investment in affordable housing, which could generate $20 million
                    or more in additional investments in affordable housing if leveraged over a 30 year term and preserve the financial value of past capital investments in affordable housing; and

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, further review of the state entities’ affordable housing delivery system is warranted given the substantial resources currently dedicated to funding that system and the potential for savings and efficiencies.

                    from regulated and unregulated chemicals in the State; and
                </p>
                <p>

                    other items, any recommended legislative or regulatory actions to reduce risks to human health and the environment from regulated and unregulated chemicals of emerging concern; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the Committee met routinely and consulted with a citizen advisory panel on proposed recommendations for legislative or regulatory actions to reduce risks from chemicals, including the development of a general framework to be used by the Committee
                    to review and analyze risks posed by chemicals in order to consider appropriate changes to applicable recordkeeping, reporting, and other technical requirements; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the Committee submitted a report to the Governor on December 15, 2018. The report included recommendations for the establishment of a more specific process for coordinated State review of the risks to human health and the environment posed by
                    chemicals, classes of chemicals, or groupings of chemicals, including chemicals of emerging concern, that are used or proposed for use in Vermont; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the chemical review process recommended by the Committee will provide a consistent and deliberative framework for the State’s evaluation of chemicals and risks posed by those chemicals and will provide a transparent and coordinated approach to
                    identifying and implementing legislative, regulatory or other changes needed to protect Vermonters and the environment from such risks.

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermont’s workforce has declined significantly since the great recession with fewer Vermonters working or looking for work while employers struggle to fill good jobs; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, a majority of Vermont’s counties have not returned to pre-recession employment levels; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, we must do more to ensure that all of Vermont’s villages, towns, cities and counties have the tools to strengthen their communities and expand economic opportunity; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, economic and community development is a high priority for Vermont’s municipalities, employers and Vermonters; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermont has a number of abandoned, idled and underused industrial and commercial sites and facilities where redevelopment is difficult because of contamination (referred to as brownfields); and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, developers report complicated issues involved in brownfield redevelopment projects in areas where development priorities exist (i.e. designated downtowns) — including State and federal regulations and permitting requirements overseen by multiple
                    agencies, in addition to liability, lender requirements and other legal concerns — make them more expensive and complex to pursue and develop; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the Brownfields Economic Revitalization Alliance or “BERA” has successfully utilized technical support and funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for all of its pilot projects to date; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the EPA recognizes the importance of BERA and continues to provide technical support and funding for BERA pilot projects; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the BERA serves an essential function in coordinating and prioritizing the deployment of State and federal resources to assist and guide developers of properties facing environmental and permitting challenges in evaluating, planning, and mitigating
                    hazards; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, for Vermont to expand its economy and attract employers, the Governor has identified the need for a coordinated, predictable and transparent process for brownfield redevelopment projects while also protecting public health, safety and the environment;
                    and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, in order to ensure effective and efficient planning related to hazard and environmental mitigation and permitting related to brownfields redevelopment there is a need for a “one-stop-shop” to assist landowners and developers with accessing State
                    and federal resources, navigating regulations and permitting requirements and planning and coordinating the redevelopment of these properties on behalf of the people of Vermont.

                    NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor do hereby formally constitute the Brownfields Economic Revitalization Alliance (“BERA”) Program, to coordinate, utilize and deploy all available
                    federal, State, private sector and volunteer and non-governmental agency resources, including funding, in the remediation, permitting and redevelopment coordination of BERA Program designated properties as follows:

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, our natural, cultural and physical recreation assets can and should be leveraged to sustain, grow and drive economic development in all sectors of Vermont’s economy with particular attention to the segment that includes outdoor recreation industry

                            to administer the program, potential funding sources, staffing needs, and whether to include other recreational trails. The recommendations should include any proposed changes to legislation to promote the construction and
                            operation of trails in an environmentally protective manner. The Agency of Natural Resources shall consult with stakeholders including the Vermont Trails and Greenways Council in developing recommendations.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the Governor, pursuant to the Vermont Constitution Chapter II, Section 3 and 3 V.S.A. Section 2001 and Section 2002, may make such changes in the organization of the Executive Branch or in the assignment of functions among its units as he considers
                    necessary for efficient administration; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the Constitution of Vermont, Chapter II, Section 6 provides that no bill, resolution or other thing which shall have been passed by one house of the General Assembly shall have the effect of or be declared to be a law without the concurrence
                    of the other, ensuring no action by a single house, committee or agent of the General Assembly may be binding on the Executive Branch; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, any organizational changes made by the Governor, pursuant to 3 V.S.A. Section 2001 and Section 2002, shall be subject to disapproval by both houses of the General Assembly; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, it is desirable to reorganize the agencies, departments and divisions of government by better coordinating certain activities and improving the coordination and effectiveness of services to the public; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Act 250 has operated under the same administrative structure for over fifty years, consisting of District Environmental Commissions (“District Commissions”), administrative tribunals comprised of three volunteer members of the public, operating
                    independently in 9 regions of the State; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, from 1970 through 2004, the former Environmental Board oversaw the operations of the District Commissions and established policy precedents across the Act 250 enterprise through the issuance of decisions in appeals of Act 250 permits; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, when the Natural Resources Board replaced the Environmental Board in 2004, the Natural Resources Board did not retain its ability to compel consistent application of policy and law across the nine District Commissions through the issuance of
                    decisions in Act 250 appeals; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, while Act 250 has served Vermont well, the scope and complexity of environmental, planning, and regulatory issues District Commission must consider has expanded significantly since 1970; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, with complex emerging issues such as climate change, the interplay between Act 250 and other state and municipal regulatory programs, demographic challenges, and the growing economic divide between the rural and urban parts of our state, and
                    with a current governance structure that lacks a unifying policy authority across the nine districts, restructuring Act 250 presents an opportunity to maximize natural resource protections, enable well planned growth, increase predictability
                    and reduce redundancy with other state regulatory programs; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, a professional Natural Resources Board that decides major cases will have the capacity to consider and manage complex issues now and into the future, and, through their Orders, will establish precedent and policy resulting in the consistent application
                    of Act 250 criteria statewide; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, in each proceeding of the restructured Natural Resources Board, two members from the District Commission from the District where the proposed project is located will sit with the Natural Resources Board so regional considerations will continue
                    to inform Act 250 decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NOW THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, Chapter II, Section 3 and Section 20, 3 V.S.A. chapter 41 and

                    the possession of 224 milligrams or less of buprenorphine on the theory that greater street availability will result in fewer opioid-related deaths and a greater likelihood those with substance misuse disorder will seek treatment;

                </p>
                <p>
                    NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Howard Dean, by virtue of the power vested in me as Governor, do hereby reconstitute the “Vermont Army National Guard Memorial Trust Fund” as the “Vermont National Guard Trust Fund” (hereinafter referred to as the
                    “Trust”) and establish a Trust Fund Board with the duties and responsibilities as follows:

                    <li id="t3Ac20s20-24ol11">
                        The Trust will be for the benefit of all members of the Vermont National Guard.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t3Ac20s20-24ol12">
                        The Trust Fund Board will be chaired by the Adjutant General for the State of Vermont, and be comprised of the Deputy Adjutant General for the State of Vermont, the Vermont Army National Guard Assistant Adjutant General, and the Air National Guard Assistant
                        Adjutant General.  A majority of the sitting members shall constitute a quorum and action taken by the board under the provisions of this Executive Order may be authorized by a majority of members present and voting at any regular
                        or special meeting.  The members of the board will not receive any remuneration for their participation on the board except for the reimbursement of reasonable business expenses and/or operational costs.

                        The Trust Fund shall be administered by the board and effectuate the policies and purposes of this Executive Order. Deposits to the currently existing monies shall be made to the fund from moneys appropriated thereto by the general assembly from time
                        to time and from any other source, private or public, as approved by the board.  Unexpended balances and any earnings shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the fund for use in accord with the purposes of this
                        Executive Order.

                        The original purpose of the Fund was to benefit the members of the Vermont National Guard in time of federal activation during an emergency and, in keeping with that purpose, the fund will continue to be used for members of the Vermont National Guard
                        in times of federal activation during emergencies, war, rebellion, humanitarian effort, operations other that war and in times of state active duty.  The board will establish rules and regulations governing the expenditure of funds
                        under these conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t3Ac20s20-24ol15">
                        In further keeping with the original intent of the fund, the Board may disburse part of fund as a discretionary fund to be used for the purpose of the betterment of the members of the Vermont National Guard.  But under no circumstance will this allocation
                        and disbursement reduce the total fund to an amount lower than $30,000, an amount to be used for the purposes stated in paragraph 4 above.

                        The Fund, principle and interest, will be invested and reinvested in commercially reasonable investment vehicles as approved by the Board.

                        If the Board deems necessary, the Board may contract with and/or hire investment consultants, brokers, counselors, or the like and the cost therefore, will be borne by the fund.

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, we need a forum for honest, respectful and fact-based discussions about how all Vermonters can play a role to reduce the risk of violence in our communities, including identifying root causes and developing avenues for open conversations about
                    behavior, mental health, firearm safety, the breakdown of civil discourse and personal responsibility; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, there is no single solution and Vermonters themselves must be part of any effort to ensure supportive communities, healthy families and positive school climate that are based on inclusion and promoting resiliency and acknowledging these contribute
                    to positive social and emotional development in children; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermont is not immune to the risk of extreme violence in our schools and communities as evidenced by the recent events in Fair Haven, Vermont which resulted in criminal charges being brought against an 18-year-old former student in connection
                    with what court records show to be a detailed plan to conduct a mass shooting at his former high school in Fair Haven, Vermont; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermont is currently one of the healthiest and safest states in America with many of the best - and safest - schools in the country; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, we are also reminded, while we can plan for the eventuality of these horrific events, this is an opportunity to focus our efforts on understanding and addressing the root causes of violent behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor, do hereby create the Governor’s Community Violence Prevention Task Force as follows:

                    WHEREAS, the 2019 Vermont State Emergency Management Plan (SEMP) provides the framework for the State’s emergency management enterprise across the five mission areas identified in the National Preparedness Goal: Prevention, Protection, Response, Mitigation,
                    and Recovery; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the SEMP provides the mechanism for the notification, coordination, and deployment of state and federal resources, if necessary, to assist local jurisdictions in responding to, mitigating against, and recovering from disasters, regardless of
                    cause; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the SEMP is formulated to utilize all available federal, state, private sector, and volunteer and non-governmental agency resources in responding to or supporting the response to a disaster; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the 2019 SEMP replaces the 2013 State Emergency Operations Plan and builds on lessons learned and best practices during disaster responses, exercises, and workshops; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the Plan further includes a focus on ensuring that components are streamlined and more operational and integrates the revised National Incident Management System (NIMS) doctrine released in October 2017; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, State Agencies and Departments, private sector entities, and volunteer and non-governmental organizations described in the plan partner and participate in prevention, protection, response, mitigation, and/or recovery activities and as part of
                    the plan have an obligation to provide services and support that save lives and protect property and the environment during a disaster.

                    Assignments within the Plan are based on functional capabilities and statutory responsibilities of each partner. To make the Plan viable, participants must be prepared to execute their assignments when called upon during an emergency and sustain that
                    effort during the subsequent recovery.
                </p>
                <p>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, since December 2019, Vermont has been working in close collaboration with the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and with the United States Health and Human Services Agency to monitor and plan for the potential for an outbreak
                    of respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus (a disease now known as COVID-19), in the United States; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, this rapidly evolving global situation required the Governor to direct the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) to activate the Health Operations Center in February 2020 when VDH began to monitor and later, test Vermonters who may have been exposed
                    to COVID-19; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, in March 2020, the Governor directed Vermont Emergency Management (VEM) to assemble an interagency taskforce, and later to activate the Vermont State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC), in accordance with the State Emergency Management Plan,
                    to organize prevention, response, and mitigation efforts and share information with local and state officials; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, VDH detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, we now know that while most individuals affected by COVID-19 will experience mild flu-like symptoms, some individuals, especially those who are elderly or already have severe underlying chronic health conditions will have more serious symptoms
                    and require hospitalization; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, both travel-related cases and community contact transmission of COVID-19 have been detected in the region and this transmission is expected to continue; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, if no mitigation steps are taken, COVID-19 would likely spread in Vermont at a rate similar to the rate of spread in other states and countries, and the number of persons requiring medical care could exceed locally available resources; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, it is critical we take steps to control outbreaks of COVID-19, particularly among those who are elderly or already have underlying chronic health conditions, to minimize the risk to the public, maintain the health and safety of Vermonters, and
                    limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermonters must come together as we have before in a crisis, to do our part to protect the very ill and elderly by preventing and slowing the spread of this virus and ensure those who experience the most severe symptoms have access to the care
                    they need.

                            to expedite postponement of all non-essential adult elective surgery and medical and surgical procedures, including all dental procedures in the safest but most expedient way possible.

                        <p>
                            At all times, the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), hospital and intensive care unit beds, and ventilators should be considered, even in areas that are not currently dealing with COVID-19 infections. While case-by-case evaluations will be
                            made by clinicians, the following factors are to be considered as to whether planned surgery should proceed:

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            • Health and age of the patient, especially given the risks of concurrent COVID-19 infection during recovery

                            This Addendum to the Executive Order shall take effect upon signing and shall continue in full force and effect until April 15, 2020, at which time the Governor, in consultation with the Vermont Department of Health and Agency of Human Services, the Department
                            of Public Safety/Division of Emergency Management shall assess the emergency and determine whether to amend or extend this Order as it relates to the suspension of adult elective surgery and medical and surgical procedures,

                            WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out (“Executive Order”), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response
                            to COVID-19; and

                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, the Executive Order expressly recognized the critical need to take steps to control outbreaks of COVID-19, particularly among those who are elderly or already have underlying chronic health conditions, to minimize the risk to the public, maintain
                            the health and safety of Vermonters, and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities; and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health, the Governor has directed a number of mitigation strategies for the State in order to protect individuals at risk for severe illness; and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, to aggressively address COVID-19, conservation of critical resources such as ventilators and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is essential, as well as limiting exposure of patients and staff to COVID-19; and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, after receiving updated recommendations from the U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. College of Surgeons, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid, and in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health and the Vermont Association
                            of Hospitals and Health Systems, the Governor determined it was necessary to suspend all non-essential adult elective surgery and medical and surgical procedures, including dental procedures, pursuant to Addendum 3 to the Executive
                            Order as of March 20, 2020, in order to help protect patients, reduce exposure to healthcare providers and preserve PPE; and

                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health and representatives of Vermont healthcare providers, has determined a limited resumption of outpatient services, including clinic visits, diagnostic imaging and limited
                            outpatient surgeries and procedures is appropriate at this time.
                        </p>

                            NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, the emergency powers set forth in 20 V.S.A. §§ 8, 9 and 11 and other laws, hereby authorize the Commissioner
                            of the Vermont Department of Public Health to issue mitigation requirements and procedures for the resumption of clinic visits, diagnostic imaging and such outpatient surgeries and procedures that have a minimal impact on inpatient
                            hospital bed capacity and PPE levels, including those performed in the office or ambulatory surgical care setting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Commissioner of the Department of Public Health, with the approval of the Governor, may, from time-to-time, update and modify the mitigation requirements and procedures regarding the resumption of additional adult elective surgery and medical and
                            surgical procedures, including dental procedures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Health has determined that a COVID-19 outbreak has occurred and providers cannot safely care for Vermonters in a way that (1) limits the exposure of patients and staff to COVID-19; (2) preserves PPE and
                            ventilators; and (3) preserves inpatient hospital capacity, it will notify and require all providers in the region to return to the standards set out in Addendum 3 to the Executive Order. Depending on the severity of the outbreak,
                            the Vermont Department of Health may require all Vermont providers to return to those standards.

                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out (“Executive Order”), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response
                            to COVID-19; and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, since that time, the number of cases of COVID-19 which have been tested as presumptively positive in the State has grown exponentially and unfortunately the State has seen its first deaths from this disease; and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, the Executive Order expressly recognized the critical need to take steps to control outbreaks of COVID-19, particularly among those who are elderly or already have underlying chronic health conditions, to minimize the risk to the public, maintain
                            the health and safety of Vermonters, and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities; and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, VDH is urging all residents of the State to limit normal everyday activities outside of the home and to practice social distancing at all times to limit the spread of this highly contagious and potentially deadly virus; and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, consistent with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines regarding social distancing, and in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health (VDH), the Governor has directed a number of mitigation strategies for the State in
                            order to reduce close contact among individuals, including the closure of bars and restaurants, schools and day care centers and close contact businesses; limiting the size of mass gatherings; postponing all non-essential medical
                            procedures; and ordering all businesses to implement telecommuting where possible; and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, the Governor understands most Vermonters, Vermont communities and Vermont businesses recognize the potentially disastrous effects of COVID-19 if we were to continue business as usual, and have taken responsible, common sense, and creative measures
                            to conduct our businesses and our lives in a manner consistent with CDC and Vermont Department of Health social distancing guidelines; and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, nonetheless, further measures are needed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 to, avoid needless illness and deaths while ensuring the continuity of functions critical to public health and safety and our economic and national security.

                                    WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and almost two months later Vermont has experienced over 900 cases and over 50 related deaths; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out (“Executive Order”), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response
                                    to COVID-19; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, the Executive Order expressly recognized the critical need to take steps to control outbreaks of COVID-19, particularly among those who are elderly or already have underlying chronic health conditions, to minimize the risk to the public, maintain
                                    the health and safety of Vermonters, and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities; and
                                </p>

                                    WHEREAS, consistent with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines regarding social distancing, and in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health (VDH), the Governor has directed a number of mitigation strategies for the State in
                                    order to protect individuals at risk for severe illness; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, after consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health, the Governor determined it was necessary to require Vermonters to stay home and to limit travel to essential activities only, and suspend the operation of all non-essential
                                    businesses and non-profit governmental services pursuant to Addendum 6 to the Executive Order as of March 24, 2020 (Stay Home/Stay Safe), in order to help reduce the spread of COVID-19; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State and the region would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters
                                    and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, the Governor has undertaken a cautious, incremental and evidence-based approach to restarting Vermont’s economy and continues to do so with a limited reopening of retail businesses.
                                </p>

                                    had previously been determined to be non-critical services under Stay Home/Stay Safe, effective Monday, May 18, 2020. The limited, incremental, and phased resumption of business, non-profit and government entity operations
                                    shall begin with non-essential retail; and mitigation requirements and procedures issued by the Secretary shall require implementation of appropriate occupancy limits and physical distancing, health and sanitation and

                            WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and a little more than a month later Vermont has experienced over 760 cases and 30 related deaths; and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out (“Executive Order”), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response
                            to COVID-19; and

                            WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with VDH and the Vermont Agency of Human Services, has initiated aggressive and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public safety in this public health emergency including issuing
                            Addenda to the Executive Order to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning through the end of the school year, suspending the operation of close
                            contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe with exceptions for essential purposes on transactions, and suspending the operation of businesses which are not
                            deemed critical; and

                        <p>
                            WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State and the region would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters
                            and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

                                    WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and almost two months later Vermont has experienced over 860 cases and over 45 related deaths; and

                                    WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out (“Executive Order”), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response
                                    to COVID-19; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with VDH and the Vermont Agency of Human Services, has initiated aggressive and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public safety in this public health emergency including issuing
                                    Addenda to the Executive Order to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning through the end of the school year, suspending the operation
                                    of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe with exceptions for essential purposes and suspending the operation of businesses which are not
                                    deemed critical; and
                                </p>

                                    WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State and the region would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters
                                    and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
                                </p>

                                    WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and almost two months later Vermont has experienced over 900 cases and over 50 related deaths; and

                                    WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out (“Executive Order”), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response
                                    to COVID-19; and

                                    WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with VDH and the Vermont Agency of Human Services, has initiated aggressive and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public safety in this public health emergency including issuing
                                    Addenda to the Executive Order to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning through the end of the school year, suspending the operation
                                    of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe with exceptions for essential purposes and suspending the operation of businesses which are not
                                    deemed critical; and

                                    WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State and the region would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters
                                    and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

                                    • Continue to limit non-essential travel; all travel should be limited to Vermont to the extent possible and when you do travel, limit non-essential stops. Anyone who leaves Vermont for more than one day for non-essential travel is required to quarantine

                                            WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and almost two months later Vermont has experienced almost 1,000 cases and over 50 related deaths; and

                                            WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out (“Executive Order”), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response
                                            to COVID-19; and

                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, the Executive Order expressly recognized the critical need to minimize the risk to the public, maintain the health and safety of Vermonters, and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities and imposed
                                            a limit on the size of mass gatherings; and

                                            WHEREAS, consistent with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines regarding social distancing, and in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health (VDH), the Governor has directed a number of mitigation strategies for the State in
                                            order to protect individuals at risk for severe illness, including suspension of the operations of close contact businesses, additional limits on the size of gatherings and self-quarantine requirements for those
                                            travelling to Vermont to stay; and

                                            WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State and the region would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters
                                            and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

                                            WHEREAS, the Governor has undertaken a cautious, incremental and evidence-based approach to restarting Vermont’s economy and continues to do so with the limited reopening of close contact businesses and incremental increases to the size of gatherings.

                                            at risk for severe illness, including self-quarantine requirements for residents and non-residents travelling to Vermont to stay; and

                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State and the region would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters
                                            and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

                                            WHEREAS, the Governor has undertaken a cautious, incremental and evidence-based approach to restarting Vermont’s economy and continues to do so with the modification of the State’s quarantine requirements to facilitate travel into Vermont without home-quarantine
                                            for a period of fourteen (14) days, based on data regarding rates of COVID-19 infection; and

                                            WHEREAS, the impact of COVID-19 on the Northeast United States has been significant with approximately 41 percent of all confirmed U.S. cases located within a 5-hour drive of the Vermont border, however, analysis by the State has found many counties in
                                            New York and New England currently have a low active case count making the risk of COVID-19 transmission for those traveling from those counties to Vermont low.

                                            WHEREAS, since December 2019, Vermont has been working in close collaboration with the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and with the United States Health and Human Services Agency to monitor and plan for the potential for an outbreak
                                            of respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus (a disease now known as COVID-19), in the United States; and

                                            WHEREAS, this rapidly evolving global situation required the Governor to direct the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) to activate the Health Operations Center (HOC) in February 2020 when VDH began to monitor and later, test Vermonters who may have been
                                            exposed to COVID-19; and

                                            to COVID-19 (extended April 10 and May 15, 2020); and

                                            and Directives issued pursuant to the Executive Order to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning through the end of the 2019-2020
                                            school year, directing the postponement of non-essential medical and surgical procedures, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work from home, requiring Vermonters
                                            to stay home and stay safe with exceptions for essential purposes and suspending the operation of businesses which were not deemed critical to public health and safety and national and economic security; and

                                            and would have threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

                                            reopening our business, non-profit, government and recreation sectors in a safe and effective way; and

                                            to facilitate the medical response, health and safety requirements, expanded housing and meal delivery systems, expanded eligibility for unemployment insurance, tools needed by certain businesses to maintain
                                            a minimum level of economic sustainability, and federal emergency funding; and

                                    State of Vermont in response to COVID-19; and

                                    WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with the Vermont Department of Health (VDH), Department of Public Safety/Division of Emergency Management (DPS), the Vermont Agency of Human Services (AHS) and the Agency of Education (AoE), initiated aggressive
                                    and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public safety in this public health emergency including issuing the Executive Order, as supplemented and amended, and Directives issued pursuant
                                    to the Executive Order, to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, directing the postponement
                                    of non-essential medical and surgical procedures, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe, with exceptions for

                                    WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and would
                                    be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

                                    WHEREAS, in mid-April, the Governor began to undertake a cautious, measured and data-based approach to restarting Vermont’s economy to minimize the risk to the public by limiting the spread of infection in our communities in order to protect the most
                                    vulnerable, while reopening our business, non-profit, government and recreation sectors in a safe and effective way; and

                                    WHEREAS, since December 2019, Vermont has been working in close collaboration with the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and with the United States Health and Human Services Agency to first monitor and plan for outbreaks of a
                                    respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and then to implement measures to keep Vermonters healthy and safe; and

                                    WHEREAS, the Governor directed the Vermont Department of Health (“VDH”) to activate the Health Operations Center in February 2020 when VDH began to monitor and later, test Vermonters who may have been exposed to COVID-19; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, in March 2020, the Governor directed the Department of Public Safety, Division of Vermont Emergency Management (“DPS”) to assemble an interagency taskforce, and later to activate the Vermont State Emergency Operations Center (“SEOC”), in accordance
                                    with the State Emergency Management Plan, to organize prevention, response and mitigation efforts and share information with local and state officials; and

                                    WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, VDH detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and as of September 9, 2020, the State has experienced 1,654 cases and 58 deaths which are COVID-19 related; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out (“Executive Order”), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response
                                    to COVID-19; and

                                    WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, President Trump issued a national emergency declaration for the COVID-19 pandemic; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with VDH, DPS and the Vermont Agency of Human Services, initiated aggressive and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public safety in this public health emergency including issuing
                                    the Executive Order, as supplemented and amended and Directives issued pursuant to the Executive Order, to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of
                                    remote learning through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, directing the postponement of non-essential medical and surgical procedures, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting
                                    and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe, with exceptions for essential purposes, and suspending the operation of businesses which were not deemed critical to public health and safety and

                                    WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and would
                                    be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

                                    WHEREAS, the Governor has undertaken a cautious, measured and data-based approach to restarting Vermont’s economy to minimize the risk to the public by limiting the spread of infection in our communities in order to protect the most vulnerable, while
                                    reopening our business, non-profit, government and recreation sectors in a safe and effective way; and

                                    WHEREAS, numerous tools needed to address response efforts remain in place by virtue of the State of Emergency declaration, including protections for residents of long term and other medical care facilities, National Guard resources standing by to implement
                                    hospital surge capacity and for emergency food distribution, workplace health and safety requirements, a mandate for facial coverings, expanded housing and meal delivery systems, expanded eligibility for unemployment
                                    insurance, tools needed by certain businesses to maintain a minimum level of economic sustainability and federal emergency funding; and

                                    WHEREAS, the General Assembly has passed a number of COVID-19-related measures dependent on the existence of a declared State of Emergency which provide flexibility regarding unemployment insurance, assist Vermonters with motor vehicle licensing and other
                                    matters, impose moratoria on evictions and water and sewer service disconnection, protect Vermonters in public meeting settings and provide municipalities flexibility with budgeting and municipal taxes; and

                                    WHEREAS, the Governor has determined, in consultation with the Commissioner of VDH and DPS, based on the best science and data available, to extend the State of Emergency for the State of Vermont through Tuesday, September 15, 2020, clarify the use of
                                    facial coverings when engaged in strenuous activity and clarify the delegated authority of the Secretary of Administration for State agency and department return to the worksite.

                                    WHEREAS, since December 2019, Vermont has been working in close collaboration with the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and with the United States Health and Human Services Agency to first monitor and plan for outbreaks of a
                                    respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and then to implement measures to keep Vermonters healthy and safe; and

                                    WHEREAS, the Governor directed the Vermont Department of Health (“VDH”) to activate the Health Operations Center in February 2020 when VDH began to monitor and later, test Vermonters who may have been exposed to COVID-19; and

                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, in March 2020, the Governor directed the Department of Public Safety, Division of Vermont Emergency Management (“DPS”) to assemble an interagency taskforce, and later to activate the Vermont State Emergency Operations Center (“SEOC”), in accordance
                                    with the State Emergency Management Plan, to organize prevention, response and mitigation efforts and share information with local and State officials; and

                                    WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, VDH detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and as of November 13, 2020, the State has experienced 2,651 cases and 59 deaths which are COVID-19 related; and

                                    WHEREAS, on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic; and
                                </p>

                                    to COVID-19; and

                                    the Executive Order, as supplemented and amended and Directives issued pursuant to the Executive Order, to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of
                                    remote learning through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, directing the postponement of non-essential medical and surgical procedures, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting
                                    and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe, with exceptions for essential purposes, and suspending the operation of businesses which were not deemed critical to public health and safety and
                                    national and economic security; and

                                    WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and would
                                    be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

                                    WHEREAS, the Governor undertook a cautious, measured and data-based approach to restarting Vermont’s economy to minimize the risk to the public by limiting the spread of infection in our communities in order to protect the most vulnerable, while reopening
                                    our business, non-profit, government and recreation sectors in a safe and effective way; and
                                </p>

                                    WHEREAS, despite months of success, statewide there is an acceleration in COVID-19 transmission; from November 8, 2020 to November 12, 2020, the number of new cases reported statewide increased at a rate as high as 50% per day (from 23 to 47 to 72 and
                                    to 109 cases); and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, in accordance with the Executive Order, as amended and restated, the Commissioner of VDH has determined that COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred, attributing this surge to a number of factors, primarily increased informal social gatherings involving
                                    alcohol, both indoors and outdoors, among people of different households, thus increasing the exposure of Vermonters and visitors to COVID-19, spreading the disease into more homes and workplaces and threatening to
                                    overwhelm our hospitals and health care resources; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, the Commissioner has advised the Governor on the appropriate return to more limited standards of operation and social gatherings in order to control outbreaks of COVID-19, particularly among those who are elderly or already have underlying chronic
                                    health conditions, minimize the risk to the public, maintain the health and safety of Vermonters and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, without a return to more limited standards of operation and social gatherings, as well as a requirement for greater cooperation by Vermonters with VDH contact tracing efforts, COVID-19 would likely continue to spread in Vermont at a rate similar
                                    to the rate of spread in other states and countries, and the number of persons requiring medical care could exceed available resources; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, the Governor has determined, in consultation with the Commissioner of VDH, that with Vermont’s aggressive advances in the areas of contact tracing, surveillance testing and diagnostic and surveillance testing, it is possible to limit standards
                                    of operation and social gatherings, while keeping Vermonters working and our children in school; and
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    WHEREAS, Vermonters must come together as we have before in this crisis, to do our part to protect the very ill and elderly, ensure those who experience the most severe symptoms have access to the care they need, and keep our schools and economy open,
                                    by preventing and slowing the spread of this virus; and
                                </p>

                                            be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

                                            WHEREAS, since December 2019, Vermont has been working in close collaboration with the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and with the United States Health and Human Services Agency to first monitor and plan for outbreaks of a
                                            respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and then to implement measures to keep Vermonters healthy and safe; and

                                            WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, VDH detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and as of January 14, 2021, the State has experienced 9,573 cases (an increase of over 3,700 cases in a one-month period), and 164 deaths (68 additional

                                            WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out (“Executive Order”), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response
                                            to COVID-19; and

                                            the Executive Order, as supplemented and amended and Directives issued pursuant to the Executive Order, to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution
                                            of remote learning through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, directing the postponement of non-essential medical and surgical procedures, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting
                                            and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe, with exceptions for essential purposes, and suspending the operation of businesses which were not deemed critical to public health and safety
                                            and national and economic security; and

                                            WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and would
                                            be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, the Governor undertook a cautious, measured and data-based approach to restarting Vermont’s economy to minimize the risk to the public by limiting the spread of infection in our communities in order to protect the most vulnerable, while reopening
                                            our business, non-profit, government and recreation sectors in a safe and effective way; and

                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, Vermonters must come together as we have before in this crisis, to do our part to protect the very ill and elderly, ensure those who experience the most severe symptoms have access to the care they need, and keep our schools and economy open,
                                            by preventing and slowing the spread of this virus; and

                                            WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and would
                                            be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
                                        </p>

                                            our business, non-profit, government and recreation sectors in a safe and effective way; and

                                            illness or death from COVID; and

                                            WHEREAS, numerous tools needed to address response efforts remain in place by virtue of the State of Emergency declaration, including protections for residents of long term and other medical care facilities, National Guard resources standing by to assist
                                            with the COVID-19 response, workplace health and safety requirements, public gathering limitations, a mandate for facial coverings, expanded housing and meal delivery systems, expanded eligibility for unemployment

                                            and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public safety in this public health emergency including issuing the Executive Order, as supplemented and amended, to, among other things,
                                            direct the Commissioner of the Department of Labor to extend unemployment insurance to those Vermonters following the instructions of their health care providers to self-isolate or quarantine; to remove the
                                            work search requirement for those workers affected by temporary closure of a business; to temporarily suspend any mechanisms that would delay the release of funds to claimants; and to relieve employers of charges
                                            for benefits paid to an individual for reasons related to COVID-19 for the duration of the Emergency Declaration; and

                                            WHEREAS, in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic rendered thousands of Vermonters jobless through no fault of their own, when they were laid off because their employers were forced to close their doors or severely restrict the services they could offer to the public;
                                            and

                                            WHEREAS, many Vermont employers lost significant income or revenue because they were limited in their capacity to serve the general public or open their doors in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19; and

                                            WHEREAS, in 2020 Acts and Resolves No. 91 (the “Act”), Section 30, the General Assembly reiterated the Governor’s policies of ensuring unemployment insurance for those Vermonters who temporarily or permanently lost their jobs due to COVID-19, and relief
                                            for employers from charges for benefits paid to an individual for circumstances related to COVID-19, however the Act did not fully contemplate the duration of the pandemic or the severity of its economic consequences;
                                            and

                                            in the COVID-19 health emergency including issuing the Executive Order, as supplemented and amended and Directives issued pursuant to the Executive Order, to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size
                                            of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, directing the postponement of non-essential medical and surgical procedures, suspending
                                            the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe, with exceptions for essential purposes, and suspending the operation of
                                            businesses which were not deemed critical to public health and safety and national and economic security; and

                                            WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken at that time, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State would have had a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and threatened
                                            to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
                                        </p>

                                            vulnerable, while reopening our business, non-profit, government and recreation sectors in a safe and effective way; and

                                            WHEREAS, the COVID-19 vaccine in Vermont is bringing much needed relief and, together with federal efforts, the Governor is proceeding to roll out vaccine delivery in a methodical, deliberate process designed to protect the Vermonters most vulnerable
                                            to severe illness or death from COVID, as well as return our children to school full-time as quickly as possible; and

                                            resources standing by to assist with the COVID-19 response, workplace health and safety requirements, public gathering limitations, a mandate for facial coverings, expanded housing and meal delivery systems
                                            and associated federal emergency funding, expanded eligibility for unemployment insurance, tools needed by certain businesses to maintain a minimum level of economic sustainability and enhanced protections to
                                            prevent evictions and utility service disconnection; and

                                            WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency (“Executive Order”), as amended and restated June 15, 2020 (“Amended and Restated Executive Order”), declaring a state of emergency for the
                                            State of Vermont in response to COVID-19; and

                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, all states in the region, including Vermont, have experienced community transmission of COVID-19 which has led to hundreds of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths within a five hour drive of Vermont’s borders; and
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with the Vermont Department of Health (VDH), has initiated aggressive and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public safety in this health emergency including issuing the Executive
                                            Order, as amended and restated, and Directives issued pursuant to the Executive Order to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning
                                            through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, directing the postponement of non-essential medical and surgical procedures, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work
                                            from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe with exceptions for essential purposes and suspending the operation of businesses which were not deemed critical to public health and safety and national
                                            and economic security; and

                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, beginning in April 2020, the Governor undertook a cautious, measured and data-based approach to restarting Vermont’s economy to minimize the risk to the public by limiting the spread of infection in our communities to protect the most vulnerable,
                                            while reopening business, non-profit, government and recreation sectors in a safe and effective way; and

                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, in connection with the Governor’s cautious, measured and data-based approach to restarting Vermont’s economy in a safe and effective way, on April 20, 2020, the Governor issued Addendum 10 to the Executive Order that established health and safety
                                            requirements to be followed by all employers and employees, including mandatory facial coverings for employees when in the presence of others, and strongly encouraged all Vermonters to wear facial coverings
                                            when in the presence of others; and
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, on May 1, 2020 the Governor issued Addendum 12 to the Executive Order that required facial coverings on public transit conveyances, including ride services, and in mass transportation facilities; and
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, on June 15, 2020, the Governor issued an Amended and Restated Executive Order which reiterated existing mask policies and recommended Vermonters use facial coverings when in contact with individuals from outside their household, and especially
                                            when maintaining a physical distance of six feet was not possible; and

                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, on July 24, 2020, in anticipation of colder weather, more frequent indoor gatherings and the coming flu season, the Governor issued Addendum 2 to the Amended and Restated Executive Order directing all Vermonters to wear masks or cloth facial
                                            coverings over their nose and mouth in most instances when they are in public spaces, and in contact with others from outside their households; and
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken by the Governor, the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and COVID-19 related deaths in the State would have had a much more devastating effect on Vermonters
                                            and threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, the mitigation measures taken in 2020, including significant testing and contact tracing capacity, mask-wearing and other health and safety protocols, substantial federal financial aid, food distribution and emergency housing, prepared Vermonters,
                                            healthcare institutions and schools for the spike in COVID-19 cases in late fall and early winter to such an extent Vermont was able to avoid a substantial roll-back of Vermont’s ongoing restart efforts; and
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, thanks to the initiation of Vermont’s nation-leading vaccination program and continued adherence by Vermonters to the State’s safety measures and substantial uptake of vaccine, Vermont is now seeing significant decreases in its rate of hospitalizations
                                            and deaths; and
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, this trend has allowed the Agency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD), in consultation with VDH, with the approval of the Governor, to release the Vermont Forward Roadmap to Reopening: Phased Reopening Plan (“Vermont Forward”), to relieve
                                            restrictions on the operations of businesses and non-profit and government entities as certain vaccination goals are met; and
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, the CDC has recently acknowledged, and the science and data strongly indicate that, transmission of COVID-19 in outdoor settings is very rare, the Governor, in consultation with VDH, the Department of Financial Regulation and the Department of
                                            Public Safety, has determined that the data and conditions in Vermont support further reducing restrictions on all Vermonters when outside.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, Chapter II, Section 20 and under 20 V.S.A. §§ 8, 9 and 11, hereby order the amendment of the Amended and Restated

                                        <p>
                                            As of Friday, April 30, 2021, Vermonters are no longer required to wear face coverings over nose and mouth when they are in outdoor public spaces, provided sustained or prolonged close contact with individuals from outside their household can be avoided.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            For clarity, “sustained or prolonged contact” is defined as more than several minutes. “Close contact” is defined as being less than six-feet from an individual from outside your household. For example, masking would not be required when passing someone
                                            on the sidewalk or at an outdoor market. Put another way, when you are outdoors, masks are only required when you are in a crowd or with multiple other households where you cannot avoid close contact.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The Commissioner of VDH, with the approval of the Governor, is hereby delegated the authority to implement and update guidance regarding the use of masks or cloth facial coverings required indoors or outdoors in public.

                                        <p>
                                            Nothing in this Order or any other State health and safety guidance shall require the use of a mask or cloth facial covering when someone is engaged in strenuous exercise or activity, for anyone under the age of 2, any child or adult with a medical or
                                            developmental issue or challenge that is complicated or irritated by a facial covering, anyone with difficulty breathing or as further set forth in guidance issued by VDH. A person who declines to wear a mask
                                            or cloth face covering because of a medical or developmental issue, or difficulty breathing, shall not be required to produce documentation, or other evidence, verifying the condition.

                                            and restated, and Directives issued pursuant to the Executive Order to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning through the
                                            end of the 2019-2020 school year, directing the postponement of non-essential medical and surgical procedures, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work from home,
                                            requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe with exceptions for essential purposes and suspending the operation of businesses which were not deemed critical to public health and safety and national and economic

                                            WHEREAS, beginning in April 2020, the Governor undertook a cautious, measured and data-based approach to restarting Vermont’s economy to minimize the risk to the public by limiting the spread of infection in our communities to protect the most vulnerable,
                                            while reopening business, non-profit, government and recreation sectors in a safe and effective way; and

                                            WHEREAS, in connection with the Governor’s cautious, measured and data-based approach to restarting Vermont’s economy in a safe and effective way, on April 20, 2020, the Governor issued Addendum 10 to the Executive Order that established health and safety
                                            requirements to be followed by all employers and employees, including mandatory facial coverings for employees when in the presence of others, and strongly encouraged all Vermonters to wear facial coverings

                                            WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken by the Governor, the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and COVID-19 related deaths in the State would have had a much more devastating effect on Vermonters
                                            and threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

                                            Vermonters, healthcare institutions and schools for the spike in COVID-19 cases in late fall and early winter to such an extent Vermont was able to avoid a substantial roll-back of Vermont’s ongoing restart
                                            efforts; and

                                            WHEREAS, thanks to the initiation of Vermont’s nation-leading vaccination program and continued adherence by Vermonters to the State’s safety measures and substantial uptake of vaccine, Vermont is now seeing significant decreases in its rate of hospitalizations
                                            and deaths; and
                                        </p>

                                            WHEREAS, this trend has allowed the Agency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD), in consultation with VDH, with the approval of the Governor, to release the Vermont Forward Roadmap to Reopening: Phased Reopening Plan (“Vermont Forward”), to relieve
                                            restrictions on the operations of businesses and non-profit and government entities as certain vaccination goals are met; and

                                            WHEREAS, the CDC has recently issued new guidance, based on the science and data, that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing COVID-19 infections and, in the very rare instances where a fully vaccinated person contracts the virus, that fully
                                            vaccinated person has a far less severe, often asymptomatic, case and there is low risk of transmitting COVID-19 to unvaccinated people; and

                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, in light of this updated CDC guidance the Governor, in consultation with VDH and the Department of Public Safety, has determined that the data and conditions in Vermont support removing facial covering requirements for fully vaccinated people
                                            in most situations; and
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, numerous tools needed to address response efforts remain in place by virtue of the State of Emergency declaration, including protections for residents of long term and other medical care facilities, licensing and regulatory flexibility needed
                                            to facilitate the medical response, health and safety requirements, expanded housing and meal delivery systems, moratoria on evictions and water and sewer service disconnection, expanded eligibility for unemployment
                                            insurance, tools needed by certain businesses to maintain a minimum level of economic sustainability, and federal emergency funding; and

                                        <p>
                                            WHEREAS, the Governor has determined, in consultation with the Commissioner of VDH and the Department of Public Safety, based on the best science and data available, to extend the State of Emergency for the State of Vermont, effective Saturday May 15,
                                            2021 through Tuesday, June 15, 2021.

                                            to COVID-19; and

                                            the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to develop a plan to extend DMV licensing and registration renewal deadlines and other statutory and regulatory DMV requirements to mitigate contagion

                                            at risk for severe illness, including, among numerous other measures, suspension of all in-person transactions at the DMV; and

                                            and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermont, the first state to outlaw slavery, played an important role in the abolition movement, opposed and legislated against the Fugitive Slave Act, and provided numerous stops on the Underground Railroad; and

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the bravery of Vermonters on the battlefield is well documented, including the First Vermont Brigade which saw action in nearly every major eastern battle; the Second Vermont Brigade which broke the right flank of Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg;
                    the Battle of Cedar Creek, memorialized in the State House painting, in which more Vermont units were involved than in any other battle; and the Vermont-led attack that broke Confederate lines at Petersburg; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the Confederate raid on St. Albans was the northernmost land action of the War, Vermont manufacturers provided large quantities of war material, including rifle-muskets, gun-making machinery, and wool for uniforms, and women worked tirelessly
                    to provide the Vermont soldiers with necessary items at the front and in hospitals; and

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Vermont’s Civil War story extends beyond the battlefields, to include places, sites and stories throughout the state that are vital to understanding the causes, consequences, and the human experience of the war, and its larger meaning in the

                <p>

                    the Underground Railroad and resistance to slavery, citizen mobilization, and profound social, economic, and demographic impact on Vermonters, soldiers and civilians alike, to provide a deep insight into the war’s causes, conduct,
                    and long-term effects, and Vermonters will be given an opportunity to gather and share their community and individual discoveries of local Civil War history.

                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service allocated Vermont’s share of the Recovery Zone Bond volume caps to the State and sub-allocated the caps among 11 Vermont counties; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the Assistant Judges in 9 of those 11 counties, pursuant to their authority, have waived their counties’ respective allocations and re-allocated their share of volume caps to the State of Vermont; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, on October 14, 2009, the State of Vermont Emergency Board, pursuant to its authority to allocate private activity volume cap among bond issuing instrumentalities of the State, will consider allocating all Recovery Zone Facility Bonds’ volume
                    cap waived by the counties to the Vermont Economic Development Authority, an instrumentality of the State of Vermont; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, in October, 2009, the Joint Fiscal Committee of the Vermont General Assembly, pursuant to its authority, will consider approving the Governor’s allocation of the Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds’ volume cap waived by the counties to the
                    Vermont Municipal Bond Bank, an instrumentality of the State of Vermont, and to the State of Vermont should there be capacity not used by the Vermont Municipal Bond Bank; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the purpose of Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds is to promote economic activity through expenditures that promote development or other economic activity in a recovery zone designated as such by the county or State, as applicable, that
                    is the recipient of volume cap; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the purpose of the Recovery Zone Facility Bonds is to finance property used in the active conduct of a trade or business in a recovery zone; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, Recovery Zone Bonds are a significant resource to the State of Vermont and will stimulate economic activity, increase employment opportunities and mitigate the effects of the national recession; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the Code requires that all Recovery Zone Bonds be issued prior to January 1, 2011 and it is imperative that recovery zones in Vermont be designated as soon as possible to ensure that Vermont and Vermonters realize the full benefit of the bonds;
                    and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, the Code defines a recovery zone, among other things, as an area designated by the issuer as having significant poverty, unemployment, rate of home foreclosures, or general distress; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, unemployment in Vermont has nearly doubled statewide during the current downturn and every county of the state has suffered at least a doubling of unemployment since 2007 leading to significant general distress; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, 28% of Vermonters work outside their county of residence and new jobs created anywhere in the state will significantly benefit those impacted by the recession; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, projected state general fund revenues for FY2010 are 15% below actual revenues in FY2008 and are, in fact, less than actual FY2005 revenues and this severe impact on state revenues will be mitigated by development and construction anywhere in
                    the state; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHEREAS, there is no area of Vermont that has not been significantly impacted by the recession and it is urgent to address both the problems of unemployment and declining revenues in Vermont.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NOW, THEREFORE, I, James H. Douglas, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor, do hereby designate the entire State of Vermont as a recovery zone under the Code as amended by ARRA. This designated recovery zone shall pertain to any Recovery
                    Zone Bonds issued by the State of Vermont, the Vermont Economic Development Authority, the Vermont Municipal Bond Bank, and any other instrumentality of the State that may later receive an allocation of Recovery Zone Bond volume caps
                    from the State.

                <p>
