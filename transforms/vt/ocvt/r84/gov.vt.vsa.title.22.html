     <p>
      Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities; to authorize cooperation and sharing with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a cooperative basis, and to authorize cooperation and sharing among localities, states and others in providing joint or cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing and potential library resources make the provision of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and efficient service.

       Designation of archaeological sites.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The State Archaeologist, with the approval of the State Historic Preservation Officer, may publicly designate an archaeological site of significance to the scientific study or public representation of the State’s historical, prehistorical, or aboriginal past as a “State archaeological landmark.” All State agencies administering State-owned lands containing State archaeological landmarks shall cooperate to ensure the protection of these landmarks. State archaeological landmarks located on privately owned land shall not be designated without the written consent of the owner. Upon designation of an archaeological site the private owner or affected State agency shall be given written notice of the designation by the State Archaeologist. Once so designated, no person may conduct field activities without first securing a permit from the State Historic Preservation Officer and complying with the provisions of section 762 of this title.

Superior title to all objects recovered shall be retained by the State unless or until they are released to the permittee by the State Archaeologist.
