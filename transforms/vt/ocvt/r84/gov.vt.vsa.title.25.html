      When it becomes necessary for a person rightfully engaged in running logs down a river or stream in this State to anchor a boom for such logs on land bounding upon such river or stream, and he or she is unable to agree with the owner or occupant of such land with reference thereto, such person may call upon the selectboard of the town wherein such land lies to act in the premises, by giving at least 48 hours’ notice in writing thereof to such owner or occupant.
      Thereupon the selectboard shall investigate and decide as to the necessity and location of such boom, the time during which it shall remain, and the amount of damage, if any. The decision of the selectboard shall be in writing and be final. When such person has paid or tendered to the selectboard his or her fees in the matter and to the owner or occupant of such land the damages awarded, the boom may be anchored in accordance with the findings of the selectmen.
