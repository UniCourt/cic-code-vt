        3 V.S.A. § 3081
       </cite>
       shall have the purpose of developing and administering a correctional program designed to protect persons and property against offenders of the criminal law and to render treatment to offenders with the goal of achieving their successful return and participation as citizens of the State and community, to foster their human dignity and to preserve the human resources of the community.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c01s01ol1b">
       The Department shall formulate its programs and policies recognizing that almost all criminal offenders ultimately return to the community, and that the traditional institutional prisons fail to reform or rehabilitate, operating instead to increase the risk of continued criminal acts following release. The Department shall develop and implement a comprehensive program that will provide necessary closed custodial confinement of frequent, dangerous offenders, but that also will establish as its primary objective the disciplined preparation of offenders for their responsible roles in the open community. The Department shall ensure that the comprehensive program required by this subsection includes a process by which each offender sentenced to any term of imprisonment other than for life without parole, within 30 days after receiving his or her sentence, shall begin to develop and implement a plan preparing for return to the community.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c01s01ol1c">
       In order to implement its programs and policies the Department shall develop and maintain correctional facilities that shall include both residence-centered institutions and facilities reflecting nonresidence principles designed to facilitate the reintegration of the offender into the community.  These facilities shall utilize the supporting resources of probation and parole services, the increased cooperation of personnel in the fields of welfare, health, and education, and the increased participation of the citizens of the State in attempts to achieve correctional purposes and objectives.

       State policy.   It is the policy of this State that principles of restorative justice be included in shaping how the criminal justice system responds to persons charged with or convicted of criminal offenses, and how the State responds to persons who are in contempt of child support orders. The policy goal is a community response to a person’s wrongdoing at its earliest onset, and a type and intensity of sanction tailored to each instance of wrongdoing. Policy objectives are to:
       <ol>
        <li id="t28c01s2aol1a1">
         Resolve conflicts and disputes by means of a nonadversarial community process.

         Repair damage caused by criminal acts to communities in which they occur, and to address wrongs inflicted on individual victims.

        <li id="t28c01s2aol1a3">
         Reduce the risk of an offender committing a more serious crime in the future, that would require a more intensive and more costly sanction, such as incarceration.

      </li>
      <li id="t28c01s2aol1b">
       Implementation.   It is the intent of the General Assembly that law enforcement officials develop and employ restorative justice approaches whenever feasible and responsive to specific criminal acts, pursuant to
       <cite class="vt_code">
        3 V.S.A. §§ 163
       </cite>
       and 164, concerning court diversion; 13 V.S.A. chapter 221, concerning sentencing; and the provisions of this title, concerning persons in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections. It is the further intent of the General Assembly that such restorative justice programs be designed to encourage participation by local community members, including victims, when they so choose, as well as public officials, in holding offenders accountable for damage caused to communities and victims, and in restoring offenders to the law-abiding community, through activities:
       <ol>
        <li id="t28c01s2aol1b1">
         That require offenders to:
         <ol type="A">
          <li id="t28c01s2aol1b1A">
           acknowledge wrongdoing and apologize to victims;
          </li>
          <li id="t28c01s2aol1b1B">
           make restitution for damage to the victims, consistent with provisions of 13 V.S.A. chapter 221 and of this title;

          <li id="t28c01s2aol1b1C">

        </li>
        <li id="t28c01s2aol1b2">
         That aid in the recovery of victims, recognizing that victims, particularly of violent crime, often suffer lifelong effects and, accordingly, must feel safe and involved in any program offered to assist them.

        <li id="t28c01s2aol1b3">

        Statutes setting forth purposes of Department of Corrections and responsibilities of Commissioner did not compel conclusion that Vermont furlough statute required individual furlough assessments for each inmate prior to inmate’s minimum release date. Parker v. Gorczyk, 170 Vt. 263, 744 A.2d 410, 1999 Vt. LEXIS 323 (1999).

        Commissioner of Department of Corrections acted within authority conferred upon him by Legislature in promulgating policy which would make prisoners convicted of violent felonies ineligible for furlough until expiration of their minimum sentences.

       <p>
        Establishment of programming requirements falls within the Commissioner of Corrections’ explicit power to establish inmate treatment programs. The Department of Corrections is not an inferior court or tribunal of the Superior Court of Vermont, nor is it performing the functions of a quasi-judicial body when it establishes programming requirements; rather, the Commissioner is fulfilling his statutorily created responsibilities to establish classification and commitment programs for each inmate in a correctional facility and to periodically review such programming decisions. Rheaume v. Pallito, 2011 VT 72, 190 Vt. 245, 30 A.3d 1263, 2011 Vt. LEXIS 67 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the decision to designate a sex offender as highly dangerous could be termed a quasi-judicial act—likely the reason why the Legislature explicitly provided for judicial review of designation decisions—the promulgation of programming requirements falls within the broad discretion of the Department of Corrections to determine what mode of treatment best serves individual inmates. Broad discretion must be granted to correctional authorities to determine what mode of treatment will best serve the individual inmate, and nothing in the statutes limits that discretion. Rheaume v. Pallito, 2011 VT 72, 190 Vt. 245, 30 A.3d 1263, 2011 Vt. LEXIS 67 (2011).

        The Legislature’s grant of power to contract with private collection agencies for the collection of court-ordered fines does not prevent a trial court from ordering a different means of collection when individual circumstances merit it in the probation context. State v. Powers, 173 Vt. 550, 789 A.2d 962, 2001 Vt. LEXIS 419 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature’s grant of power to contract with private collection agencies for the collection of court-ordered fines does not preclude the Department and the Commissioner from carrying out their responsibility “[t]o administer the supervision of persons placed on probation,” and “maintain general supervision of persons placed on probation... consistent with any orders of the court,” even when those court orders specify a means of payment of a fine that would prevent it from being contracted out to a collection agency. State v. Powers, 173 Vt. 550, 789 A.2d 962, 2001 Vt. LEXIS 419 (2001).

        Authority to enter into contract to transfer Vermont inmates to an out-of-state facility was well within the powers reasonably and necessarily implied by the fundamental obligation of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections to maintain prison safety and order, and the Commissioner’s express and unfettered statutory authority to designate, assign and transfer inmates.

       Inmate’s claim for mandamus relief was based on sufficient standing, as he claimed that he was personally harmed by the Department of Corrections’ failure to engage in a competitive bidding process in order to provide telephone services to inmate as the lowest reasonable cost. Wool v. Menard, 2018 VT 23, 207 Vt. 25, 185 A.3d 577, 2018 Vt. LEXIS 25 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s claim for mandamus relief was sufficiently stated, as he established the elements to show that he had a clear legal right to the relief sought of having the Department of Corrections seek a competitive contract for telephone services to inmates. Wool v. Menard, 2018 VT 23, 207 Vt. 25, 185 A.3d 577, 2018 Vt. LEXIS 25 (2018).

      <p>
       Inmate’s allegation that Vermont law required the Department of Corrections (DOC) to use competitive bidding to contract for telephone services and that DOC violated this requirement by using a sole-source contract provided DOC with sufficient notice of the basis of his claim for purposes of surviving a dismissal motion.

     <p>
      Whenever used in this chapter, unless a different meaning plainly is required, “probation” means a procedure under which a respondent, found guilty of a crime upon verdict or plea, is released by the court, without confinement, subject to conditions imposed by the court and subject to the supervision of the Commissioner.

        Effect of violation.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an obvious connection between a suspended sentence imposed for an underlying crime and the reimposed sentence following a defendant’s violation of probation conditions. The reinstatement of an original sentence following a probation violation, however, does not transform a probation violation and an underlying criminal offense into the same act. State v. Bohannon, 2010 VT 22, 187 Vt. 410, 996 A.2d 196, 2010 Vt. LEXIS 22 (2010).
      </p>

        Restitution.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       On its face, the restitution statute simply is not applicable to situations where no crime has occurred. It is universally acknowledged that a probation revocation proceeding is not essentially “criminal” in nature, and other courts have made a similar distinction between a probation violation and the underlying crime; it follows, therefore, that a probation violation is not a separate crime sufficient to independently trigger the restitution statute. State v. Bohannon, 2010 VT 22, 187 Vt. 410, 996 A.2d 196, 2010 Vt. LEXIS 22 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Expenses for which restitution was being sought were not the direct result of the crime for which defendant was convicted and sentenced; instead, the expenses associated with extradition were directly related to the separate probation violation of leaving the state of Vermont without permission or notice to defendant’s parole officer and taking up residence in the state of Washington. Thus, they could not be made the subject of a restitution order. State v. Bohannon, 2010 VT 22, 187 Vt. 410, 996 A.2d 196, 2010 Vt. LEXIS 22 (2010).

       In sentencing a defendant convicted of dispensing marijuana in a correctional facility, court could properly consider statements by corrections officials in the presentence investigation report as to the problem of drugs in correctional facilities and the possible deterrent effect of defendant’s sentence on that problem.

      </p>
      <p>
       A three-week delay in filing a presentence investigation report was not prejudicial to the defendant, so long as the report on the defendant was furnished to the court before it imposed sentence. State v. Rathburn, 140 Vt. 382, 442 A.2d 452, 1981 Vt. LEXIS 641 (1981).

        Inspection by defendant.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant seeking access to another individual’s presentence investigation report (PSI) must support the request with a plausible showing of materiality; upon such a showing, the court should review the PSI in camera and disclose only that information, if any, that is material to guilt or punishment. State v. Bacon, 167 Vt. 88, 702 A.2d 116, 1997 Vt. LEXIS 243 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not make a plausible showing that information in other individual’s presentence investigation reports (PSIs) was material to his sentencing: He did not claim that the requested PSIs contained information concerning his culpability or aggravating and mitigating factors, but sought only to compare himself with other individuals who had been sentenced to life-without-parole. Even if it was assumed that the PSIs would have shown that these other individuals were more culpable and dangerous than defendant, that information would not have been material to his sentence, as sentencing in Vermont is individualized, with broad discretion afforded the trial court in fashioning an appropriate sentence, which may involve a wide-ranging inquiry into a defendant’s life and the nature of the offense committed. State v. Bacon, 167 Vt. 88, 702 A.2d 116, 1997 Vt. LEXIS 243 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant requested access to the presentence investigation report (PSI) of his accomplice, the court should have reviewed the accomplice’s PSI in camera and disclosed any information material to defendant’s sentence, such as motives or relative responsibility for the crime. State v. Bacon, 167 Vt. 88, 702 A.2d 116, 1997 Vt. LEXIS 243 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Policy of this section and V.R.Cr.P. 32 is that presentence investigation reports be available for inspection, in trial court’s discretion, when availability is in the best interests of defendant. In re Sevene, 136 Vt. 602, 396 A.2d 1390, 1979 Vt. LEXIS 917 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to produce presentence investigation report at request of person who had pled guilty to statutory rape and been sentenced, and who, in petition for review of sentence, stated that he was functionally illiterate and that his presentence report was not read to him until weeks after sentence, was not sound exercise of court’s discretion to make report available, and dismissal of petition had to be vacated where court had not considered the report, yet found that petitioner failed to substantiate claim that inaccuracies in it were grounds for vacating plea and sentence. In re Sevene, 136 Vt. 602, 396 A.2d 1390, 1979 Vt. LEXIS 917 (1979).

      </p>
      <p>
       The qualified First Amendment right of access that attaches to documents submitted by parties in sentencing hearings does not extend to presentence investigation reports (PSI) prepared at the request of, and for the benefit of, the sentencing court, which are protected by
       <cite class="vt_code">
        28 V.S.A. § 204(d)
       </cite>
       and have historically not been open to the press and public. This conclusion is not affected by the fact that some information contained in a PSI may become public during the sentencing process, as the documents themselves have been, and continue to be, treated as confidential. Much information contained in PSIs, including that provided by defendants themselves, remains private. State v. LaBounty, 167 Vt. 25, 702 A.2d 82, 1997 Vt. LEXIS 183 (1997).

       Age-related impairment in a person’s ability to, for example, manage his or her own finances does not foreclose the possibility that the person may still be capable of expressing himself or herself regarding a matter upon which he or she is called to testify. Thus, a person may be found to be a “vulnerable adult” and the victim of a charge of exploiting a vulnerable adult, but still be competent to testify according to the Vermont Rules of Evidence and for the purposes of sentencing consideration.

       With regard to defendant’s Ex Post Facto Clause claim, designating defendant “high risk” was for the sole purpose of increasing public access to his status as a sex offender and related information. Although the trial court held that the statute prohibiting early release until 70 percent of the defendant’s maximum sentence was completed violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, that statute had no legal effect on the length of defendant’s incarceration. Defendant could point to no statute or administrative directive that retroactively removed or limited the Vermont Department of Corrections’ discretion over his treatment programming and that consequently resulted in a longer period of incarceration.

       Appellate court found it was the best interpretation of the interface between U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 4A1.2(c)(1)(A) and
       <cite class="vt_code">
        28 V.S.A. § 205
       </cite>
       that the duration of an indefinite sentence of probation for purposes of Guidelines § 4A1.2(c)(1)(A) was the duration of the period for which the sentencing court continued the probation in effect.
       Under this view, an indefinite term of probation was a term of probation of at least one year if the sentencing court continued the probation for at least one year. United States v. Tomasi, 313 F.3d 653, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 24495 (2d Cir. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       When read as consistent with order from bench, court’s written order imposed an indeterminate probation period from which defendant was not to be discharged “until further order of court”; in this form, probation condition was explicitly authorized by subsection (a) of this section. State v. Lloyd, 169 Vt. 643, 740 A.2d 364, 1999 Vt. LEXIS 308 (1999) (mem.).

      </p>
      <p>
       Parole board’s decision to place defendant on parole had no effect on his sentence, and defendant’s completion of parole had no bearing on his status as a probationer because he had not yet been released from probation; defendant therefore remained bound by probation agreement, and his probation was properly revoked for violation of its terms.

        When a prisoner on probation is convicted of a subsequent offense, criterion imposed by section 7032 of Title 13, governing imposition of consecutive sentences, that a subsequent conviction must occur before the defendant has been discharged from a prior sentence, must be read with reference to this section and section 255 of this title, governing discharge from probation; together, they permit a subsequent court, in its discretion, to impose a sentence consecutive to probation.

        Trial court properly held that it lacked the authority to terminate defendant’s probation obligations and expunge his criminal convictions halfway through his stipulated deferred-sentence term, as the term of deferment could not be shortened without the State’s consent, and allowing defendant to escape the agreement’s burden after he had benefited from it would not advance the ends of justice.

        Probationer is entitled to a hearing on disputed material facts before the trial court can order a less-than-satisfactory discharge from probation. State v. Nolen, 2012 VT 106, 193 Vt. 116, 71 A.3d 1213, 2012 Vt. LEXIS 105 (2012).

        Actions by the trial court affecting defendant’s probationary status and freedom, such as a revocation of probation, require a hearing on the merits. Attaching the label of “unsatisfactory” to a defendant’s discharge from probation constitutes a legally adverse action by the trial court which requires the State to prove unsatisfactory performance and entitles the defendant to respond to the State’s allegations.

        Absent a stipulation between the parties, the trial court abused its discretion by issuing an adverse order of unsatisfactory discharge with neither findings on the underlying basis for its determination nor an opportunity for defendant to be heard on the facts in dispute. State v. Nolen, 2012 VT 106, 193 Vt. 116, 71 A.3d 1213, 2012 Vt. LEXIS 105 (2012).

       <p>
        Although the trial court erred in ordering without a hearing that defendant receive an unsatisfactory discharge from probation, the court declined to order a satisfactory discharge from probation. Whether defendant was entitled to a satisfactory discharge, and on what grounds, could be considered by the trial court on remand. State v. Nolen, 2012 VT 106, 193 Vt. 116, 71 A.3d 1213, 2012 Vt.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t28c05s02s252ol1a">
       Conditions, generally.   The conditions of probation shall be such as the court in its discretion deems reasonably necessary to ensure that the offender will lead a law-abiding life or to assist the offender to do so. The court shall provide as an explicit condition of every sentence to probation that if the offender is convicted of another offense during the period for which the sentence remains subject to revocation, then the court may impose revocation of the offender’s probation.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c05s02s252ol1b">
       Probation conditions.   When imposing a sentence of probation, the court may, as a condition of probation, require that the offender:

         Make restitution or reparation to the victim of his or her conduct, or to the Victims’ Compensation Fund to the extent it has made payment to or on behalf of the victim in accordance with 13 V.S.A. chapter 167, for the damage or injury which was sustained. When restitution or reparation is a condition of the sentence, the court, in accordance with
         <cite class="vt_code">
          13 V.S.A. § 7043
         </cite>
         , shall fix the amount thereof, which shall not exceed an amount the defendant can or will be able to pay, and shall fix the manner of performance.

        <li id="t28c05s02s252ol1b17">

        Generally.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Legislature placed the power to impose probation conditions on the court, and not on the corrections department and its employees; similarly, the power to modify probation conditions also rests exclusively with the courts. State v. Rivers, 2005 VT 65, 178 Vt. 180, 878 A.2d 1070, 2005 Vt. LEXIS 145 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       A probation condition is valid if the conduct it requires is not itself criminal and is reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant was convicted. State v. Peck, 149 Vt. 617, 547 A.2d 1329, 1988 Vt. LEXIS 88 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probation conditions are statutorily authorized and constitutionally permissible if they are reasonably related to the crime for which defendant was convicted and to the purposes of sentencing, including the goal of rehabilitation, and if they are not unduly restrictive of the probationer’s liberty or autonomy. State v. Whitchurch, 155 Vt. 134, 577 A.2d 690, 1990 Vt. LEXIS 90 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due process requires that a defendant receive fair notice as to what acts may constitute a violation of his probation; in addition to the statutorily mandated certificate setting forth the conditions of release, the instructions and directions given by the probation officer can serve to provide fair notice. State v. Gleason, 154 Vt. 205, 576 A.2d 1246, 1990 Vt. LEXIS 60 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Ability to pay.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant agreed to pay restitution as part of a plea bargain agreement and did not testify at hearing, burden was on the state to prove defendant’s ability to pay and defendant’s right under subdivision (b)(6) of this section to a determination of his ability to pay was not waived. State v. Sausville, 151 Vt. 120, 557 A.2d 502, 1989 Vt. LEXIS 16 (1989).

        Amount.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In ordering restitution as a condition of probation under this section the court, in calculating the amount of restitution cannot order restitution to exceed the defendant’s ability to pay. State v. Curtis, 140 Vt. 621, 443 A.2d 454, 1982 Vt. LEXIS 467 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       In requiring, as a condition of probation, restitution to the victim for the damages sustained, the measure of damages to a motor vehicle is fair market value before the injury less fair market value after the injury. State v. Curtis, 140 Vt. 621, 443 A.2d 454, 1982 Vt. LEXIS 467 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where operator of motor vehicle was convicted of careless and negligent driving, and the trial court, as a condition of probation, ordered restitution to the owner of an automobile which the defendant had struck and damaged in the course of committing the offense, but there was no credible evidence in the record on appeal to support the court’s conclusion as to the amount of restitution order could not stand. State v. Curtis, 140 Vt. 621, 443 A.2d 454, 1982 Vt. LEXIS 467 (1982).

      <p>
       A restitution order in a criminal case is not the same as, and is no substitute for, an award of civil damages. State v. Jarvis, 146 Vt. 636, 509 A.2d 1005, 1986 Vt. LEXIS 350 (1986).

       Compliance with probation terms may not be put beyond the probationer’s control. State v. Bubar, 146 Vt. 398, 505 A.2d 1197, 1985 Vt. LEXIS 396 (1985).

       Subdivision (b)(6) of this section, which generally allows restitution as a condition of probation, is limited by section 7043 of Title 13, which specifically explains when restitution must be considered and what restitution may include. State v. Jarvis, 146 Vt. 636, 509 A.2d 1005, 1986 Vt. LEXIS 350 (1986).

      </p>
      <p>
       Probation conditions may impact upon a probationer’s First Amendment rights so long as conditions have a reasonable nexus with rehabilitation of defendant and protection of public; court has broad discretion in setting conditions of probation, and may require a probationer to satisfy any conditions reasonably related to his rehabilitation. State v. Lockwood, 160 Vt. 547, 632 A.2d 655, 1993 Vt. LEXIS 90 (1993).

        Damages not recoverable.

      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not have the statutory authority to require defendant, convicted of driving under the influence, death resulting, as a condition of probation, to pay restitution for partial support to the deceased victim’s dependents. State v. Fontaine, 167 Vt. 529, 711 A.2d 667, 1998 Vt. LEXIS 156 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Damages that are not readily ascertainable, such as pain and suffering, emotional trauma, loss of earning capacity, and wrongful death awards are not proper subjects of restitution. State v. Jarvis, 146 Vt. 636, 509 A.2d 1005, 1986 Vt. LEXIS 350 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 7043 of Title 13, governing restitution in sentencing, and subdivision (b)(6) of this section, authorizing restitution as a condition of probation, do not allow restitutory awards for a victim’s pain and suffering or emotional trauma. State v. Jarvis, 146 Vt. 636, 509 A.2d 1005, 1986 Vt. LEXIS 350 (1986).

      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that a restitution award for extradition expenses exceeded the maximum fine allowable for escape did not make it improper, because the Legislature did not intend to limit such damages based on the dollar amount in the charge against the defendant. State v. Lewis, 167 Vt. 533, 711 A.2d 669, 1998 Vt. LEXIS 165 (1998).

       Although the probation conditions imposed might be “standard” in the sense that they appeared in an internal judiciary probation order template, as well as a standard plea agreement form generated by the Court Administrator, the inclusion of these particular conditions on a form labeled “standard conditions” did not reflect a judicial determination that every condition included was presumptively valid, or that the whole package of conditions could be applied in every case; nor did this reflect a judicial determination that all of the conditions were constitutional and valid on their face and provided adequate notice of what conduct might lead to a revocation of probation. The only truly “standard” condition was the one providing that the court could revoke probation if the offender was convicted of another offense while the sentence was still subject to revocation.

       Even if the probation order did not satisfy the requirement that a probationer be given a certificate explicitly setting forth the conditions of probation, there was no plain error, as defendant received a probation order listing all of the conditions, defendant was fully aware of the information that was allegedly not provided, and any error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

      <p>
       Statute requires only that the probationer receive a probation certificate; nothing in the statute requires a defendant to sign the probation certificate, and to hold that probation does not begin until a defendant signs a probation certificate would give a defendant veto power over when the terms of probation commenced. A signature acknowledging receipt of the probation certificate is one, but not the only, way to establish that a probationer has received the required probation certificate. State v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Probation condition that prohibited defendant from engaging in criminal behavior, which was imposed after a jury convicted him of unlawful trespass, was reasonably necessary to ensure that defendant would live a law-abiding life and was well within the trial court’s statutory discretion to impose; furthermore, the condition did not reach lawful behavior and was neither vague nor unclear, and it did not give probation officers untethered discretion in that courts retained the power to revoke probation if the statutory requirements were met. State v. Richards, 2021 VT 40, 256 A.3d 94, 2021 Vt. LEXIS 52 (Vt. 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probation condition that defendant avoid pornography was improper when there was no evidence that pornography was related to his offense, his individual history, or his behaviors or that the condition was generally necessary for the rehabilitation of all sex offenders; the fact that the pornography condition was part of the sex-offender treatment program defendant was otherwise required to complete was not sufficient to support the condition. State v. Bouchard, 2020 VT 10, 211 Vt. 454, 228 A.3d 349, 2020 Vt. LEXIS 9 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a probation condition imposed upon defendant, a sex offender, on its face authorized limitless monitoring of his computer and internet use, it was not narrowly tailored to ensure a permissible balance between the government’s interests and defendant’s privacy rights, and was not reasonably necessary to help defendant lead a law-abiding life. State v. Bouchard, 2020 VT 10, 211 Vt. 454, 228 A.3d 349, 2020 Vt. LEXIS 9 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probation condition regarding pornography, erotica, and sexual establishments was not supported by the evidence. The record did not show that the crime—sexual assault of an adult—was connected to pornography, erotica, adult bookstores, sex shops, topless bars, or other similar establishments, nor did the State present evidence that defendant’s individual history or behaviors supported the condition as part of his rehabilitation or for the protection of the public. State v. Lumumba, 2018 VT 40, 207 Vt. 254, 187 A.3d 353, 2018 Vt. LEXIS 36 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to show why a probation condition completely prohibiting his alcohol possession or use was unreasonable under the circumstances. The trial court was concerned about the nature of the offense, a public brawl where defendant committed an aggravated assault while drunk and armed with a knife, and felt total abstinence from alcohol was warranted to aid in defendant’s rehabilitation. State v. Urban, 2018 VT 25, 207 Vt. 13, 184 A.3d 731, 2018 Vt. LEXIS 20 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a condition that defendant not buy, have or use any regulated drugs unless prescribed precluded conduct that was criminal, the trial court was not required to find a reasonable relationship between defendant’s conviction and the condition. State v. Putnam, 2015 VT 113, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836, 2015 Vt. LEXIS 92 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because defendant’s conviction was not related to the use of drugs or alcohol and there was no evidence that he abused drugs or alcohol, a condition allowing defendant’s probation officer to require him to submit to random urinalysis testing was invalid.

      <p>
       Probation condition stating that defendant was not to drink alcoholic beverages to the extent it interfered with his employment or the welfare of himself or his family, and that he had to submit to an alco sensor test if required by his probation officer was not supported by sufficient evidence of a reasonable relationship between defendant, the crime for which he was convicted, and the condition. Drinking alcohol to excess was not criminal, and there was no evidence that defendant’s conduct leading to his conviction was related to alcohol use. State v. Putnam, 2015 VT 113, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836, 2015 Vt. LEXIS 92 (2015).

      <p>
       Insofar as defendant was convicted of a crime relating to the operation of a motor vehicle, the court could reasonably conclude that a probation condition specifically requiring that defendant not drive without a license was reasonably related to his rehabilitation.

      <p>
       Probation condition requiring defendant to repay any unpaid amounts due for any legal services provided at state expense solely applied to a court order arising from defendant’s prosecution for the crime for which he was convicted and was therefore sufficiently related to his rehabilitation, in light of the crime of which he was convicted.

      <p>
       Probation condition requiring defendant to attend any counseling or training program designated by his probation officer and to participate to the satisfaction of his probation officer was an unlawful delegation of authority, as the probation condition gave the probation officer complete discretion in deciding whether and which counseling or training program defendant would attend, and was unsupported by particularized findings justifying not only the condition requiring counseling or training, but the broad delegation to the probation officer to determine the type of counseling or training. The error was plain, as the delegation deprived defendant of a substantial right and affected the integrity of the judicial process by giving the probation officer authority reserved to the courts. State v. Putnam, 2015 VT 113, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836, 2015 Vt. LEXIS 92 (2015).

       Probation conditions relating to the supervision of defendant by his probation officer were reasonably related to aiding defendant in leading a law-abiding life in light of the crime for which he was convicted, and were within the trial court’s discretion.

       There were no grounds to impose a probation condition requiring defendant to regularly work at a job, look for work, or get job training if required by his probation officer. Defendant was on disability at the time of the hearing, and there was no suggestion in the record that his criminal conduct was connected to his lack of employment or that getting a job, instead of remaining on disability, would help him become more stable or reduce his risk of reoffending; in fact, there was no evidence that defendant was capable of working.

      <p>
       Because there was no evidence that defendant was subject to any court orders concerning support for his family, that he had failed in any way to meet his legal obligations to any family members, or that the conduct leading to his conviction was part of a broader pattern of neglecting his responsibilities, including familial responsibilities, a condition requiring him to support his dependents and meet his family obligations was not reasonably related to defendant and the crime for which he was convicted such that it was a reasonable component of his rehabilitation.

       Probation condition requiring defendant to submit to polygraph examinations was related to the offense for which he was convicted, as this type of non-evidentiary use of a polygraph examination would help ensure that he was on track with both his rehabilitation and sex offender therapy, as well as ensure public safety, all of which related to the goals of probation and compliance investigation.

       As imposed, a probation condition requiring defendant to seek his probation officer’s approval regarding his employment was overbroad and unduly restrictive, as it gave the probation officer the authority to control defendant’s place of employment without any guiding standards, subject only to the qualification that approval “shall not be unreasonably withheld,” and without any findings of fact explaining why such a broad delegation of authority was necessary.

       Requirement that a defendant be provided with a certificate explicitly setting forth the conditions upon which he or she is being released on probation is not satisfied by a plea agreement, because the conditions of release are ultimately still set by the court at sentencing, and not by the prosecutor during plea negotiations; the conditions of release thus do not necessarily reflect all the prosecutor seeks. The terms of the plea agreement, therefore, may not be used alone to prove a violation of probation; only a signed probation order may be so used. State v.

       Retraction of probation, to be consistent with the objectives of its statutory justification, should be reserved for behavior that breaches its conditions after the probationary agreement is entered into, and to arbitrarily withdraw probation without any violative act on the person’s part is to reduce the state’s performance to something close to capricious, and a departure from the statutory objectives.

       When the court imposes a sentence upon a defendant who has been convicted of an offense enumerated in section 204a of this title that includes a period of incarceration of more than one year to serve to be followed by probation, the court may make the probation contingent on the offender fulfilling specific stated conditions, such as taking part in treatment while incarcerated, and may modify, following a hearing pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the conditions of probation if a violation has occurred.  The court shall review the probation conditions imposed at the time of sentencing after the incarceration portion of the sentence has been served, and prior to the offender’s release to probation. Such review shall include information about the offender developed after the date of sentencing, including information about the offender’s incarceration period.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c05s02s252aol1b">
       For an offender whose probation is contingent on fulfilling conditions pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Department of Corrections shall prepare a prerelease probation report to the court at least 30 days prior to the release based upon information available to the Department.  The prerelease probation report shall include the offender’s degree of participation in treatment while incarcerated, whether conditions imposed under subsection (a) of this section were complied with, and other information relevant to the offender’s release to the probationary sentence.  The Department of Corrections shall provide a copy of the prerelease probation report to the attorney for the offender and the prosecuting attorney at the same time it provides the report to the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c05s02s252aol1c">
       If the Commissioner of Corrections believes the offender has violated a condition imposed under subsection (a) of this section, he or she may recommend a change to the original probation order.  In this case, the court shall schedule a modification hearing prior to the release date.  The court may modify the conditions or add further requirements as authorized by section 252 of this title.  The offender shall have a reasonable opportunity to contest the modification prior to its imposition.  The prosecuting attorney shall represent the State in connection with any proceeding held in accordance with this section.

        Where a probation condition proscribed defendant’s interaction with all children under the age of sixteen, but made no mention of specific public locations or events where children are often present, by prohibiting defendant from attending a fair, his probation officer converted the probation condition from a contact-based condition to a location-based condition, and in so doing, the officer crossed the line between condition interpretation and modification.

        Defendant failed in his argument that the court was without authority to both increase the portion of his sentence to serve and reimpose his probation with added conditions because each of these actions is granted by separate subdivisions of
        <cite class="vt_code">
         28 V.S.A. § 304(b)
        </cite>
        . No reason can be found why the powers contained in the subsection must be mutually exclusive, and, in any event, the court’s authority to add probation conditions is also granted by subsection (a) of this section, and there is no indication in this section that it cannot be used along with other powers. State v. Woolbert, 2007 VT 26, 181 Vt. 619, 926 A.2d 626, 2007 Vt. LEXIS 52 (2007) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant’s challenge to a condition of probation came five months after it was imposed, there was no error in the trial court’s denial of defendant’s pro se motion to modify. State v. Klunder, 2005 VT 130, 179 Vt. 563, 892 A.2d 927, 2005 Vt. LEXIS 313 (2005) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature placed the power to impose probation conditions on the court, and not on the corrections department and its employees; similarly, the power to modify probation conditions also rests exclusively with the courts. State v. Rivers, 2005 VT 65, 178 Vt. 180, 878 A.2d 1070, 2005 Vt. LEXIS 145 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probation conditions contained in a sentence represent a contract between the probationer and the court; the court may modify those conditions where the modification is sought by the defendant. State v. Whitchurch, 155 Vt. 134, 577 A.2d 690, 1990 Vt. LEXIS 90 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a probation agreement is contractual, changing the terms of probation without either the probationer’s consent or a change in circumstances betrays the justifiable expectation that the agreement will be honored. State v. Day, 147 Vt. 93, 511 A.2d 995, 1986 Vt. LEXIS 361 (1986).

        When a prisoner on probation is convicted of a subsequent offense, criterion imposed by section 7032 of Title 13, governing imposition of consecutive sentences, that a subsequent conviction must occur before the defendant has been discharged from a prior sentence, must be read with reference to section 251 of this title, governing duration of probation, and this section; together, they permit a subsequent court, in its discretion, to impose a sentence consecutive to probation.

        Under Model Penal Code upon which Vermont statute is based, where sentence is made a condition of probation and the probationer is discharged before the sentence is served, the defendant does not have to serve the sentence because the state could no longer enforce the probation condition.

        Where conviction for driving under the influence, death resulting, resulted in sentence of 3 to 15 years, all suspended except one year of prison which was stayed pending an appeal during which time defendant completed probation and was discharged, argument was rejected that discharge from probation relieved defendant of all further obligations for the crime, including the one-year prison sentence; despite plain meaning, statute providing that upon fulfillment of probationary obligation a defendant shall have satisfied his sentence for the crime and cannot be required to fulfill his prison sentence
        does not apply to split sentences since such construction would be irrational and contrary to legislative intent of model penal provision from which statute derived. State v. Papazoni, 159 Vt. 578, 622 A.2d 501, 1993 Vt. LEXIS 9 (1993).

        Defendants who fit the statutory criteria of the statute regarding detention of a probationer following a charge of a violation have a statutory right to bail or release, and the conditions of that release should be determined by a consideration of the factors in the pretrial release statute. It remains the case that the court has discretion to release any probationer, but those probationers with a right to bail may not be held without bail. State v. Kane, 2016 VT 121, 203 Vt. 652, 160 A.3d 1020, 2016 Vt. LEXIS 127 (2016) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant’s underlying crime was a nonviolent felony and her probation violations—failing to meet with her probation officer, failing to keep a curfew, failing to report a change of address, and failing to comply with electronic monitoring—did not amount to new crimes, defendant had a right to conditions of release. State v. Kane, 2016 VT 121, 203 Vt. 652, 160 A.3d 1020, 2016 Vt. LEXIS 127 (2016) (mem.).

        The fact that findings of a court at a probation revocation hearing are oral and transcribed, rather than prepared and typed subsequent to the hearing, does not alter the legal standard of appellate review; in either case, if the findings are deficient, a case may be remanded to the trial court for correction.

        A probationer’s federal due process rights are adequately protected when a court states its essential findings at a probation revocation hearing on the record. State v. Allen, 145 Vt. 593, 496 A.2d 168, 1985 Vt. LEXIS 329 (1985).

        Hearsay evidence admitted by the trial court in a probation revocation hearing with regard to defendant’s discharge from a residential treatment facility did not meet any of the traditional guarantees of trustworthiness. There was no evidence to corroborate the hearsay allegations regarding defendant’s misbehavior at the facility; the evidence contained judgments and conclusions, not objective facts; and the hearsay allegations were not factually detailed, but rather stated as general statements and conclusions. State v. Decoteau, 2007 VT 94, 182 Vt. 433, 940 A.2d 661, 2007 Vt. LEXIS 242 (2007).

        Probation is intended to allow a defendant opportunity for rehabilitation at the same time it protects society; revocation of probation will result when continuation of probation conditions would be at odds with need to protect public and society’s interest in rehabilitation, in other words, when rehabilitative purposes of probation have failed and defendant is a threat to society.

        Where defendant was convicted in New York for driving while impaired, in violation of New York Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1192(1), the fact that Vermont had no crime specifically denominated as driving while impaired did not necessitate reversal of trial court’s revocation of defendant’s probation for violation of probationary condition that he not be convicted of another offense.

        Where defendant was convicted in New York for operating “a motor vehicle while his ability to operate such motor vehicle [was] impaired by the consumption of alcohol,” in violation of New York Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1192(1), there were sufficient similarities between the New York offense and section 1201(a)(2) of Title 23, prohibiting driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, to justify trial court’s revocation of defendant’s probation for violation of probationary condition that he not be convicted of another offense.

        In a probation violation case, an administrative judge properly refused to presume bias of the trial judge based on the trial judge’s comments at the original sentencing hearing, where the trial judge had warned defendant that if he did not abide by the probation conditions, he would see to it that he would serve as much of the remaining sentence as possible. While the comments could have been better phrased, they appeared to be a warning to defendant to abide by his probation conditions. State v. Bailey, 2010 VT 21, 187 Vt. 624, 992 A.2d 320, 2010 Vt.

        Following the establishment of a violation of probation the trial court erred in revoking defendant’s probation and modifying his sentence without obtaining defendant’s waiver. In re Jankowski, 2016 VT 112, 203 Vt. 418, 157 A.3d 573, 2016 Vt. LEXIS 115 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the trial court was not reviewing a programming decision of the Department of Corrections or its internal consequences, but was deciding whether to revoke defendant’s probation, remand was required when the trial court failed to determine whether defendant had violated a rule against physical violence or threats of physical violence, and when it did not exercise its discretion to determine whether the alleged violation was such that revocation should be ordered. State v. Cavett, 2015 VT 91, 199 Vt. 546, 126 A.3d 1287, 2015 Vt. LEXIS 68 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient proof that defendant violated a probation condition that he not have relationships with people with children under 18. Although there was no direct proof that a woman whom defendant had been seeing had children under 18, it could be inferred from defendant’s volunteering the information that they lived with their father out of state that they were minors; the trial court’s conclusion that defendant had a relationship with the woman was also supported by evidence that he had exchanged phone numbers with her, borrowed her car, and bought roses for her. State v. Amidon, 2010 VT 46, 2010 VT 46A, 188 Vt. 617, 8 A.3d 1050, 2010 Vt. LEXIS 83 (2010) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in revoking defendant’s probation when it found that he had violated four conditions of probation, including one that he not have friendships or relationships with people who had children under the age of 18. There was sufficient evidence from the context of a remark by defendant that the children of an acquaintance were under age 18; defendant was procedurally barred from challenging the findings of violation, as his argument was not raised during the sentencing phase or during the evidentiary hearing; defendant’s challenge to one of the four violations found did not implicate the validity of the entire proceeding; and defendant had waived his right to collaterally attack the condition in question by failing to challenge that condition after conviction. State v. Amidon, 2010 VT 46, 2010 VT 46A, 188 Vt. 617, 8 A.3d 1050, 2010 Vt. LEXIS 83 (2010) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, whose probation required him not to initiate or maintain contact with children under 18, was not found to have violated the condition based merely on incidental proximity contact in a public place. The evidence demonstrated that on a number of occasions defendant visited his son’s residence, where he knew young grandchildren would be, and visited in the yard in the midst of the children; that some of these visits lasted hours; and that defendant freely mingled with the children. State v. Bailey, 2010 VT 21, 187 Vt. 624, 992 A.2d 320, 2010 Vt. LEXIS 23 (2010) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        Term “mingle” means more than proximity contact; rather, as defined in a dictionary, it means, “to associate or unite, as
        .
        .
        . persons by ties of relationship; to join in company.” Therefore, defendant’s conduct of freely mingling with children at his son’s residence exceeded “mere proximity” to the prohibited class and violated a probation condition that required defendant not to initiate or maintain contact with children under 18. State v. Bailey, 2010 VT 21, 187 Vt. 624, 992 A.2d 320, 2010 Vt. LEXIS 23 (2010) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        By visiting his family at their home and staying for periods of up to two hours, during which time he mingled with underage family members, defendant plainly initiated and maintained contact with members of the prohibited class in violation of a probation condition that he not initiate or maintain contact with children under 18. State v. Bailey, 2010 VT 21, 187 Vt. 624, 992 A.2d 320, 2010 Vt. LEXIS 23 (2010) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the question of whether verbal threats constituted threatening behavior in the context of probation conditions had not been decided by the court, any error of law the trial court might have made in revoking defendant’s probation for verbally threatening his landlord was not obvious. Thus, there was no plain error, and the court did not have to reach defendant’s claim that his curfew violations alone, which he did not contest, did not support revocation. State v. Gilbert, 2009 VT 7, 185 Vt. 602, 969 A.2d 125, 2009 Vt. LEXIS 5 (2009) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mildly retarded adult defendant’s alleged inability to comply with conditions of probation at time of violation did not bar revocation of his probation, where evidence did not support defendant’s argument that performance of probation warrant was impossible, and court took defendant’s mental capacity into consideration at revocation hearing. State v. Lockwood, 160 Vt. 547, 632 A.2d 655, 1993 Vt. LEXIS 90 (1993).
       </p>

        Where defendant was convicted in New York for operating “a motor vehicle while his ability to operate such vehicle [was] impaired by the consumption of alcohol,” in violation of New York Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1192(1), trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant’s probation for violation of probationary condition that he not use alcoholic beverages to the extent that they interfered with his employment or the welfare of his family, himself, or any other person, since defendant posed a possible danger to the welfare of both himself and others by his operation of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate that vehicle was impaired by his consumption of alcohol.

        Since all four of defendant’s sentences were to be served concurrently, trial court acted improperly in severing defendant’s sentence on one charge after he admitted violating conditions of his probation, where effect was to alter defendant’s sentence on that charge from concurrent to consecutive, to be served after he was released from incarceration on other three charges. State v. Draper, 167 Vt. 636, 712 A.2d 894, 1998 Vt. LEXIS 136 (1998) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s delay in completing a domestic violence program and his refusal to admit to the conduct underlying his offense at the intake interview in violation of program requirements were sufficient to support the probation violation found by the trial court and the extension of the probation term by an additional year. State v. Provost, 2014 VT 86, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 87 (Vt. 2014), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 2014 VT 86A, 199 Vt. 568, 133 A.3d 826, 2015 Vt. LEXIS 74 (2015).

       <p>
        Defendant failed in his argument that the court was without authority to both increase the portion of his sentence to serve and reimpose his probation with added conditions because each of these actions is granted by separate subdivisions of subsection (b). No reason can be found why the powers contained in the subsection must be mutually exclusive, and, in any event, the court’s authority to add probation conditions is also granted by
        <cite class="vt_code">
         28 V.S.A. § 253(a)
        </cite>
        , and there is no indication in that section that it cannot be used along with other powers. State v. Woolbert, 2007 VT 26, 181 Vt. 619, 926 A.2d 626, 2007 Vt. LEXIS 52 (2007) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s sentencing power, once it has found a violation of probation, is limited to the alternatives explicitly laid out in subsection (a) of this section. State v. Pratt, 173 Vt. 562, 795 A.2d 1148, 2002 Vt. LEXIS 4 (2002) (mem.).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of subsection (a) of this section, when read together with
        <cite class="vt_code">
         28 V.S.A. § 205(a)
        </cite>
        , did not impliedly give the option to the sentencing court to suspend part of the underlying sentence. State v. Pratt, 173 Vt. 562, 795 A.2d 1148, 2002 Vt. LEXIS 4 (2002) (mem.).

        <cite class="vt_code">

        <cite class="vt_code">
         13 V.S.A. § 7041
        </cite>
        , and therefore trial court properly ruled that it was required to impose sentence after finding defendant violated a condition of probation outlined in his deferred-sentence agreement. State v. Rafuse, 168 Vt. 631, 726 A.2d 18, 1998 Vt. LEXIS 402 (1998) (mem.).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Absent a showing that the trial court abused or withheld its discretion, the enforcement of the original sentence after a finding of violation of probation is without error. State v. Peck, 149 Vt. 617, 547 A.2d 1329, 1988 Vt. LEXIS 88 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a violation of probation is established, the trial court has discretion to revoke probation and require the original sentence to be served, continue probation, or alter the conditions of probation. State v. Therrien, 140 Vt. 625, 442 A.2d 1299, 1982 Vt. LEXIS 470 (1982).

        Following the establishment of a violation of probation the trial court erred in revoking defendant’s probation and modifying his sentence without obtaining defendant’s waiver. In re Jankowski, 2016 VT 112, 203 Vt. 418, 157 A.3d 573, 2016 Vt. LEXIS 115 (2016).
