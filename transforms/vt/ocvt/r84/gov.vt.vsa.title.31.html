       The authority to license given by this section does not extend to 32 V.S.A. § 9907, imposing a fee on concession stands in the vicinity of a street or carnival show or on a fairground. Champlain Valley Exposition, Inc. v. Village Essex Junction, 133 Vt. 213, 333 A.2d 89, 1975 Vt. LEXIS 371 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section and 24 V.S.A. § 2291(11), allowing towns, cities, and incorporated villages to license and tax amusements and entertainments, must be read in pari materia as they deal with the same subject matter, and under such a reading village trustees could enact an ordinance placing a ten dollar per day license fee on amusements and entertainments. Champlain Valley Exposition, Inc. v. Village of Essex Junction, 131 Vt. 449, 309 A.2d 25, 1973 Vt. LEXIS 332 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because section 403 of this title subjects village trustees to a penalty for issuing a license for less than the minimum fee prescribed in this section, it must be assumed that they have the power to issue a license under this section.

      <p>
       By this section the legislature recognized that granting of a license for the operation of a race track with legalized pari-mutuel betting might create additional law enforcement problems and tried to make sure that the public would be given adequate police protection against incidents arising as a result of the pari-mutuel operation without any additional burden being placed on the state treasury. 1962-64 Vt. Op. Att'y Gen. 137.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the police protection referred to in this section is not merely to protect the owners of the race track, but also all other persons in attendance at the track and to safeguard the interests of all Vermonters by ensuring that the laws of Vermont are not violated. 1962-64 Vt.

       Statement of policy and purpose.
      </b>
      This Compact is enacted to implement the operation of Tri-State Lotto, for the purpose of raising additional revenue for each of the party states. Tri-State Lotto is not intended to replace any existing lottery game in the party states, but, rather, to be run in addition to these games. Tri-State Lotto tickets will be sold in each of the party states and processed in a central area to be determined by the Commission. No less than 50 percent of the gross sales from each state will be aggregated in a common prize pool, and operating costs will be charged proportionally to the party states. The remaining revenues generated within each state will remain in that particular state.

       Although the court normally does not interfere with an administrative agency’s construction of the statute it administers, the court cannot enforce administrative rules if they are inconsistent with the authorizing statute; consequently, since 31 V.S.A. § 674(L) imposes no limits on when a transfer of lottery winnings can be found appropriate, unlike Tri-State Lottery Commission Rule 11(d) which imposes such limits, Rule 11(d) is inconsistent with the statute, thus unenforceable. Lemieux v. Tri-State Lotto Commission, 164 Vt. 110, 666 A.2d 1170, 1995 Vt. LEXIS 87 (1995).

        Construction.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Tri-State Lotto Commission has the power to promulgate the rules and regulations that govern the lottery game, including the manner of selecting the winning tickets and paying the prizes, and while traditionally the supreme court has been reluctant to substitute its judgment for the experience and expertise of an agency, its overall objective is to give effect to the intent of the legislature; consequently, when interpreting the statutory language of 31 V.S.A. § 674(L)(1) that allows payment to one other than a ticketholder pursuant to an “appropriate judicial order” the court held that the words chosen by the Legislature conveyed a broad power allowing them to authorize payment to persons other than the ticketholder. Lemieux v. Tri-State Lotto Commission, 164 Vt. 110, 666 A.2d 1170, 1995 Vt. LEXIS 87 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the wide use of lottery legislation that specifically bars assignments, the absence of a provision prohibiting assignments shows that the Legislature purposefully eliminated an express prohibition on the voluntary assignment of lottery proceeds so as to allow for assignments. Lemieux v. Tri-State Lotto Commission, 164 Vt. 110, 666 A.2d 1170, 1995 Vt. LEXIS 87 (1995).
